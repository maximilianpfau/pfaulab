               intelligence (AI) to infer results of psychophysical
               examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging.
               We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in

               far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied

               and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and
               patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD,
               inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate

               successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results
               both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red
               testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of

               examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for
               mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred

  abstract  = "Dark adaptation (DA) refers to the slow recovery of visual
               sensitivity in darkness following exposure to intense or
               prolonged illumination, which bleaches a significant amount of
               the rhodopsin. This natural process also offers an opportunity
               to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate
               for presence of disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a
               key indicator of retinal health, which can be altered in the
               presence of certain diseases, such as age-related macular
               degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of DA
               measurement and its significance to furthering our understanding
               of AMD has revealed essential findings underlying the
               pathobiology of the disease. The process of dark adaptation
               involves phototransduction taking place mainly between the
               photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelial
               (RPE) layer. DA occurs over a large range of luminance and is
               modulated by both cone and rod photoreceptors. In the photopic
               ranges, rods are saturated and cone cells adapt to the high
               luminance levels. However, under scotopic ranges, cones are
               unable to respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate the
               responses to lower levels of light as they can respond to even a
               single photon. Since the cone visual cycle is also based on the
               Muller cells, measuring the impairment in rod-based dark
               adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases
               such as AMD, which involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark
               adaptation parameters are metrics derived from curve-fitting
               dark adaptation sensitivities over time and can represent
               specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod
               break (CRB) and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly
               sensitive to changes in the outer retina. There is some
               structural and functional continuum between normal aging and the
               AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod
               intercept time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD
               patients with increasing disease severity determined by
               increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the presence of
               subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain
               morphological features in the peripheral retina. Specifications
               of spatial testing location, repeatability of the testing, ease
               and availability of the testing device in clinical settings, and
               test duration in elderly population are also important. We

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare
               hereditary systemic disease that results in alterations of the
               kidneys, inner ear, and various structures of the eye. It is
               caused by mutations in one of the genes encoding collagen type
               IV. In recent years, new and innovative imaging techniques have
               added characteristics of ocular alterations in AS and provided
               new insights, including into the pathogenesis of the disease.
               The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current
               knowledge of ocular changes in AS, as well as to present the
               Alport ocular pass. METHOD: Narrative review article. RESULTS:
               Ocular manifestations of AS include changes in the cornea, lens,
               and retina. Specifically, posterior polymorphic corneal
               dystrophy, anterior lenticonus (pathognomonic for AS), and
               various retinal changes have been described, which have been
               further characterized in recent years by newer imaging
               techniques. In particular, foveal changes in AS may present as
               both a thickened central retina in the context of foveal
               hypoplasia or a staircase-like thinning of the fovea. Both
               lesions could provide further insights into the role of type IV
               collagen in ocular structures. CONCLUSION: The AS can manifest
               in various structures of the eye. The staircase-like changes of
               the central retina in AS patients indicate the important role of
               collagen type IV in the homeostasis and regular function of the
               inner retinal layers. The often mild foveal hypoplasia may
               provide clues to the role of collagen type IV in retinal
               embryogenesis. While anterior lenticonus is pathognomonic for AS
               and can be treated easily by refractive lens exchange, the only
               option currently available for retinal alterations is close
               follow-up and, if necessary, treatment of systemic complications

               of Bruch's membrane results in clinically visible lesions,
               including peau d'orange, angioid streaks, and comet tail
               lesions. Frequently, patients must be treated for secondary
               macular neovascularization. No effective therapy is available
               for treating the cause of PXE, but several promising approaches
               are emerging. Finding appropriate outcome measures remains a
               significant challenge for clinical trials in this slowly
               progressive disease. This review article provides an in-depth
               summary of the current understanding of PXE and its
               multi-systemic manifestations. The article offers a detailed
               overview of the ocular manifestations, including their
               morphological and functional consequences, as well as potential
               complications. Lastly, previous and future clinical trials of
               causative treatments for PXE are discussed.",

               systematically compare visual function tests for interventional
               trials. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS:
               Patients with SFD (n = 16) and controls (n = 20) underwent
               visual function testing (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and
               low luminance visual acuity [LLVA], contrast sensitivity,
               mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry [FCP],
               rod-mediated dark adaptation [RMDA]), and multimodal imaging.
               Vision-related quality of life was evaluated. FCP and RMDA
               thresholds were analyzed using mixed models and
               structure-function correlation using machine learning (ML).
               Longitudinal data of 1 patient with high-dose vitamin A
               supplementation were available. RESULTS: Although photopic BCVA
               was normative in SFD, LLVA was impaired (0.30 LogMAR [0.20;
               0.45] vs 0.20 LogMAR [0.03; 0.28], P < .05). Scotopic visual
               function exhibited a delayed rod-intercept time (21 minutes
               [12.15; 21] vs 4.05 minutes [3.22; 5.36], P < .001), and marked
               DA cyan mean sensitivity loss (-11.80 dB [-3.47; -19.85]),
               paralleled by a reduced vision-related quality of life. ML-based
               structure-function correlation allowed prediction of mesopic, DA
               cyan, and red sensitivity with high accuracy (cross-validated
               mean absolute error: 4.36, 7.77, and 5.31 dB, respectively),
               whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the absence of fundus
               alterations on multimodal imaging. After high-dose vitamin A
               supplementation, RMDA and DA thresholds improved markedly.
               CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SFD exhibit severely impaired
               scotopic visual function even in the absence of funduscopic
               alterations on multimodal imaging. In contrast to BCVA, scotopic
               visual function tests are suitable to quantify dysfunction in
               the early stages. Improvement of scotopic dysfunction after
               (off-label) high-dose vitamin A intake, as observed in one
               patient in our study, is compatible with the hypothesized local
               deficiency of vitamin A secondary to Bruch's membrane

               (CC) flow alterations in early Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) and
               to investigate the relationship of the CC flow deficits with the
               choroidal and outer retinal microstructure. METHODS: In this
               prospective case-control study, 18 eyes of 11 patients with
               early SFD and 31 eyes of 31 controls without ocular pathology
               underwent multimodal imaging, including spectral-domain optical
               coherence tomography (OCT), followed by deep-learning-based
               layer segmentation. OCT angiography (OCTA) was performed to
               quantify CC flow signal deficits (FDs). Differences in CC FD
               density between SFD patients and controls were determined, and
               the relationships with choroidal thickness, retinal pigment
               epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness and outer retinal
               layer thicknesses were analyzed using mixed-model analysis.
               RESULTS: SFD patients exhibited a significantly greater CC FD
               density than controls (estimate [95\% CI]: +20.0\%FD [13.3;
               26.7], p < 0.001 for SFD patients), even when adjusted for age.
               Square-root transformed choroidal thickness was a structural OCT
               surrogate of the CC FD density (-2.1\%FD per $\surd$µm, p <
               0.001), whereas RPEDC thickness was not informative regarding CC
               FD (p = 0.061). The CC FD density was associated with an altered
               microstructure of the overlying photoreceptors (outer segments,
               inner segments, and outer nuclear layer thinning of -0.19
               $\mu$m, -0.08 $\mu$m and -0.30 $\mu$m per \%FD, respectively,
               all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with early SFD exhibit
               pronounced abnormalities of CC flow signal on OCTA, which are
               not limited to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen on OCT imaging.
               Thus, analysis of the CC flow may enable clinical trials at

              stages and its association with structural changes of the choroid
              and outer retina. Methods: Thirty-two eyes of 21 patients with
              PXE and 35 healthy eyes of 35 controls were included. The density
              of choriocapillaris flow signal deficits (FDs) was quantified on
              6 $\times$ 6-mm optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)
              images. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
              images were analyzed for thicknesses of the choroid and outer
              retinal microstructure and correlated with choriocapillaris FDs
              in the respective Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
              subfield. Results: The multivariable mixed model analysis for
              choriocapillaris FDs revealed significantly higher FDs associated
              with the group (PXE patients vs. controls +13.6; 95\% confidence
              interval [CI] 9.87-17.3; P < 0.001), with increasing age (+0.22\%
              per year; 95\% CI 0.12-0.33; P < 0.001), and with retinal
              location (significantly higher FDs in nasal compared to temporal
              subfields). Choroidal thickness (CT) did not differ significantly
              between both groups (P = 0.078). The CT and choriocapillaris FDs
              were inversely correlated (-1.92 µm per \%FDs; interquartile
              range -2.81 to -1.03; P < 0.001). Larger values of the
              choriocapillaris FDs were associated with significant thinning of
              the overlying photoreceptor layers (outer segments: -0.21 µm per
              \%FDs, P < 0.001; inner segments: -0.12 µm per \%FDs, P = 0.001;
              outer nuclear layer: -0.72 µm per \%FDs; P < 0.001). Conclusions:
              Patients with PXE display significant alterations of the
              choriocapillaris on OCTA even in pre-atrophic stages and in the
              absence of significant choroidal thinning. The analysis favors
              choriocapillaris FDs over choroidal thickness as a potential

               correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane in patients
               with PXE. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective,
               single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted
               at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February
               20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of
               40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was
               completed March 15, 2020. Exposures: Mesopic and dark-adapted
               2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and
               multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical
               coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were
               performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed
               models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was
               performed using machine learning. Main Outcomes and Measures:
               Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss as measure of rod
               photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error
               between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the
               accuracy of structure-function correlation. Results: Of the 22
               patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were women (68\%);
               median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2).
               These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95\% CI,
               2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95\% CI,
               6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95\%
               CI, 4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was
               also evident in 9 eyes with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic:
               estimate, 3.21 dB; 95\% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted cyan:
               5.93 dB; 95\% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing:
               4.84 dB; 95\% CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal
               pattern of sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the
               periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from
               microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91
               dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for
               dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis
               highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and
               putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor
               complex with sensitivity loss. Conclusions and Relevance: In
               this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without
               choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal
               sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing.
               This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this
               Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor
               degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative
               pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair
               rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be
               correlated with overall dysfunction.",

               were imaged with swept-source OCT-A. Using ImageJ, superficial
               and deep retinal vasculature were semi-automatically analyzed
               for vessel (VD) and skeleton density (SD), vessel diameter index
               (VDI), and fractal dimension (FD). Choriocapillaris layer was
               automatically graded for mean signal intensity, signal intensity
               standard deviation, kurtosis of signal intensity distribution,
               and flow signal voids. RESULTS: Twenty-nine intermediate uveitis
               eyes and 30 control eyes were included. Both superficial and
               deep retinal layers showed significant reduction in all OCT-A
               parameters (eg, superficial retinal layer: 0.31 vs 0.40 VD,

               greater heterogeneity of perfusion with a shift toward a higher
               proportion of large confluent flow signal voids was present.
               Also in the absence of macular edema OCT-A parameters were
               reduced when compared with healthy controls (all parameters

               altered choriocapillaris perfusion are present. Moreover, these

               $\pm$ 7.20 years (63.1\% women) were included. Besides large
               drusen, the most prevalent structural feature in iAMD study eyes
               were PA (57.1\%), followed by HRF (51.8\%) and RPD (22.0\%).
               Pigment epithelium detachment lesions were observed in 4.8\%,
               vitelliform lesions in 4.2\%, refractile deposits in 3.0\%, and
               qCNV in 2.4\%. Direct precursor lesions for manifest retinal
               atrophy were detected in 10.7\% (iRORA) and 4.2\% (cRORA) in
               iAMD eyes. Overall, the highest RPEDC volume with a median of
               98.92 $\times$ 10-4 mm³ was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial
               analysis demonstrated a predominant distribution of RPD in the
               superior and temporal subfields at a foveal eccentricity of 1.5
               to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct topographic
               distribution involving the foveal center. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed
               knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD
               biomarkers is vital to identify reliable outcome measure for
               disease progression. Longitudinal analyses are needed to
               evaluate their prognostic value for conversion to advanced
               disease stages. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or

              severities had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values
              (mL/min/1.73 m2) obtained from renal function laboratory testing
              of serum creatinine and cystatin C. Multimodal imaging from visit
              dates associated with serum samples was graded by the Wisconsin

              age-corrected multivariate analyses, and a feature-selecting
              least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were
              performed for eGFR as a continuous dependent variable. Results: A

               documented pathogenic ABCA4 variant and a clinical phenotype
               consistent with ABCA4 retinopathy were recruited from a tertiary
               referral center. Participants underwent longitudinal,

              morphology and retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic
              fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in eyes with intermediate AMD.
              Methods: Thirty-five eyes from 32 patients (mean age 70.9 years)
              and 29 age-matched controls prospectively underwent
              spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging.
              Mesopic (Goldman III, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) and scotopic (Goldman
              V, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) FCP with a 56-stimulus point grid was
              performed in AMD patients with the MP-1S. Thickness values of
              different retinal layers were measured at each stimulus point and
              compared, topographically corresponding to values in controls of
              similar age for pointwise structural-functional analysis.
              Results: The overall mean sensitivity in patients was 16.9 $\pm$
              3.0 dB for mesopic and 14.0 $\pm$ 3.7 dB for scotopic testing.
              Within the central 4° of the macula, reduced mesopic and scotopic
              sensitivity values were found (P < 0.0001). These findings
              correlated to central increasing retinal pigment
              epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness and central
              decreasing outer nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor
              (PR)-segments thickness (P < 0.0001, respectively).
              Structure-function correlations revealed that a reduction of
              mesopic and scotopic sensitivity was associated with increasing
              thickness of the total retina and the RPEDC and a decrease of the

              Accumulation of sub-RPE material in patients with intermediate
              AMD is spatially associated to quantifiable structural
              alterations in various retinal layers and to corresponding
              retinal dysfunction. The topographic analysis of retinal
              thickness and retinal sensitivity will be helpful for a better

               To quantify photoreceptor degeneration outside regions of GA in
               eyes with nonexudative AMD, to evaluate its association with
               future GA progression, and to characterize its spatio-temporal
               progression. Design, Setting, and Participants: Monocenter
               cohort study (Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy
               [NCT02051998]) and analysis of data from a normative data study
               at a tertiary referral center. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of
               89 patients with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years, median
               area of GA of 8.87 mm2 (IQR, 4.09-15.60), and median follow-up
               of 1.1 years (IQR, 0.52-1.7 years), as well as 93 normal eyes
               from 93 participants. Exposures: Longitudinal spectral-domain
               optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (121 B-scans
               across 30° $\times$ 25°) were segmented with a deep-learning
               pipeline and standardized in a pointwise manner with
               age-adjusted normal data (z scores). Outer nuclear layer (ONL),
               photoreceptor inner segment (IS), and outer segment (OS)
               thickness were quantified along evenly spaced contour lines
               surrounding GA lesions. Linear mixed models were applied to
               assess the association between photoreceptor-related imaging
               features and GA progression rates and characterize the pattern
               of photoreceptor degeneration over time. Main Outcomes and
               Measures: Association of ONL thinning with follow-up time (after
               adjusting for age, retinal topography [z score], and distance to
               the GA boundary). Results: The study included 158 eyes of 89
               patients (51 women and 38 men) with a mean (SD) age of 77.7
               (7.1) years. The fully automated B-scan segmentation was
               accurate (dice coefficient, 0.82; 95\% CI, 0.80-0.85; compared
               with manual markings) and revealed a marked interpatient
               variability in photoreceptor degeneration. The ellipsoid zone
               (EZ) loss-to-GA boundary distance and OS thickness were
               prognostic for future progression rates. Outer nuclear layer and
               IS thinning over time was significant even when adjusting for
               age and proximity to the GA boundary (estimates of -0.16
               $\mu$m/y; 95\% CI, -0.30 to -0.02; and -0.17 $\mu$m/y; 95\% CI,
               -0.26 to -0.09). Conclusions and Relevance: Distinct and
               progressive alterations of photoreceptor laminae (exceeding GA
               spatially) were detectable and quantifiable. The degree of
               photoreceptor degeneration outside of regions of retinal pigment
               epithelium atrophy varied markedly between eyes and was
               associated with future GA progression. Macula-wide photoreceptor
               laminae thinning represents a potential candidate end point to

               functional AMD features. DESIGN: Longitudinal, single-center,
               case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty-eight
               participants aged > 50 years old with varying AMD severities

               assess AMD severity and hyperpigmentation (PGM) presence.
               Subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and HRF were detected on OCT
               volumes. The correlations of HRF with additional AMD features
               were evaluated using linear and logistic mixed-effects models.
               One study eye per participant underwent dark adaptation (DA)
               testing to measure rod intercept time (RIT) for structure

               changes in AMD severity and RIT were measured relative to HRF
               presence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was
               presence of HRF, which was compared with presence of other AMD
               features and DA impairment. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight
               participants (median baseline age of 73.1 [interquartile range
               (IQR) = 66-79] years) contributing 1277 eye visits were
               included. Hyperreflective foci (HRF) were detected more
               frequently in higher AMD severities. Hyperreflective-foci
               presence was significantly associated with PGM presence (odds
               ratio 832.9, P < 0.001) and SDD presence (odds ratio 9.42, P =
               0.017). Eyes with HRF demonstrated significantly longer DA
               (median 27.1 [IQR = 16-40] minutes) than those without HRF (13.5
               [10-22] minutes) but less than eyes with SDD only (40 [28-40]
               minutes). Highest RIT values were found in eyes with both HRF
               and SDD (40.0 [40-40] minutes). Age and HRF explained a similar
               proportion of RIT variability as age and SDD. Eyes that
               developed HRF demonstrated baseline RITs closer to eyes with HRF
               at baseline, compared with eyes that never developed HRF (29.1

               increased presence of HRF in higher AMD severities, and its
               correlation with previously associated AMD biomarkers, suggests
               HRF is an important OCT feature adding to the understanding of
               disease progression. Hyperreflective foci presence was
               associated with delays in DA, indicating HRF is a marker for

               Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients with TR and 118 eyes of 59
               patients with MacTel were included. Age, age of onset, and
               best-corrected visual acuity were similar in both cohorts. All
               but 1 patient showed bilateral changes. In patients with MacTel,
               neurodegenerative changes and vascular alterations were equally
               present, whereas in patients with TR, neurodegenerative changes
               usually prevailed. Predilection sites within the central retina
               differed between the 2 diseases: most findings in patients with
               TR were limited to the foveal center, whereas changes in
               patients with MacTel were present throughout a slightly larger
               region (``MacTel area''), with an epicenter temporal to the
               foveal center. Distinct morphologic features included the
               distribution of retinal crystals, the size and position of
               ellipsoid zone breaks, and the presence of hyperreflective
               changes on OCT images. Focal hyperpigmentation and neovascular
               membranes were only present in eyes with MacTel. CONCLUSIONS:
               Macular telangiectasia and TR share a highly similar retinal
               phenotype, especially in early disease stages. Subtle
               differences on multimodal retinal images may help distinguish
               between these 2 disease entities. Our findings indicate the
               involvement of M{\"u}ller cells in both diseases, which may
               explain the observed phenotypic characteristics and
               similarities.",

               association with various chorioretinal diseases. With respect to
               the broad clinical spectrum of PEDs we describe fundus
               autofluorescence (FAF) characteristics of PEDs. METHODS:
               Ninety-three eyes of 66 patients (mean age 71.9 $\pm$ 11.1) with
               uni- or bilateral PED ( $\geq$ 350 µm) were included in a
               retrospective cross-sectional study. PEDs were secondary to
               age-related macular degeneration (n = 79), central serous
               chorioretinopathy (n = 7), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n
               = 2), pattern dystrophy (n = 3) or idiopathic PED (n = 2). FAF
               images were recorded using confocal scanning laser
               ophthalmoscopy (488 nm excitation wavelength, detection of
               emission >500 nm). Diagnosis of PED was confirmed using
               spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A qualitative FAF
               grading system was established, and grading was performed by two
               independent readers. RESULTS: PEDs showed highly variable
               characteristics on FAF imaging. FAF within the area of PED was
               found to be irregular/granular (n = 59, 63.4\%), increased (n =
               28, 30.1\%), decreased (n = 3, 3.2 \%), or normal (n = 3,
               3.2\%). Accompanying FAF changes included condensation of
               macular pigment (n = 67, 72.0\%), focally increased FAF at the
               PED apex (n = 14, 15.1\%) or elsewhere (n = 52, 55.9\%), focally
               decreased FAF (n = 23, 24.7\%), a cartwheel-like pattern (n =
               10, 10.8\%), a doughnut sign (n = 6, 6.5\%), and a halo of
               decreased FAF encircling the PED (completely n = 20, 21.5\% or
               incompletely n = 20, 21.5\%). CONCLUSIONS: PEDs show a variety
               of abnormal patterns on FAF imaging. These changes in FAF
               signals may be secondary to morphological and metabolic
               alterations within corresponding retinal layers and do not
               necessarily correspond with the underlying PED subtype or a
               specific pathology.",

  abstract  = "BACKGROUND: Retinal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence
               (FAF), strongly depends on the clearness of the optical media.
               Lens status is crucial since the ageing lens has both
               light-blocking and autofluorescence (AF) properties that distort
               image analysis. Here, we report both lens opacification and AF
               metrics and the effect on automated image quality assessment.
               METHODS: 227 subjects (range: 19-89 years old) received
               quantitative AF of the lens (LQAF), Scheimpflug, anterior
               chamber optical coherence tomography as well as blue/green FAF
               (BAF/GAF), and infrared (IR) imaging. LQAF values, the Pentacam
               Nucleus Staging score and the relative lens reflectivity were
               extracted to estimate lens opacification. Mean opinion scores of
               FAF and IR image quality were compiled by medical readers. A
               regression model for predicting image quality was developed
               using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Correlation analysis
               was conducted to assess the association of lens scores, with
               retinal image quality derived from human or CNN annotations.
               RESULTS: Retinal image quality was generally high across all
               imaging modalities (IR (8.25$\pm$1.99) >GAF >BAF
               (6.6$\pm$3.13)). CNN image quality prediction was excellent
               (average mean absolute error (MAE) 0.9). Predictions were
               comparable to human grading. Overall, LQAF showed the highest
               correlation with image quality grading criteria for all imaging
               modalities (eg, Pearson correlation$\pm$CI -0.35 (-0.50 to 0.18)
               for BAF/LQAF). BAF image quality was most vulnerable to an
               increase in lenticular metrics, while IR (-0.19 (-0.38 to 0.01))
               demonstrated the highest resilience. CONCLUSION: The use of
               CNN-based retinal image quality assessment achieved excellent
               results. The study highlights the vulnerability of BAF to
               lenticular remodelling. These results can aid in the development
               of cut-off values for clinical studies, ensuring reliable data

               their related features in age-related macular degeneration
               (AMD). DESIGN: Interreader agreement study. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve
               readers from 6 reading centers. METHODS: After formal training,
               readers qualitatively assessed 60 OCT B-scans from 60 eyes with
               AMD for 9 individual features associated with early atrophy and
               performed 7 different annotations to quantify the spatial extent
               of OCT features within regions of interest. The qualitative and
               quantitative features were used to derive the presence of iRORA
               and cRORA and also in an exploratory analysis to examine if
               agreement could be improved using different combinations of
               features to define OCT atrophy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
               Interreader agreement based on Gwet's first-order agreement
               coefficient (AC1) for qualitatively graded OCT features and
               classification of iRORA and cRORA, and smallest real difference
               (SRD) for quantitatively graded OCT features. RESULTS:
               Substantial or better interreader agreement was observed for all
               qualitatively graded OCT features associated with atrophy (AC1 =
               0.63-0.87), except for RPE attenuation (AC1 = 0.46) and
               disruption (AC1 = 0.26). The lowest SRD for the quantitatively
               graded horizontal features was observed for the zone of
               choroidal hypertransmission ($\pm$ 190.8 $\mu$m). Moderate
               agreement was found for a 3-category classification of no
               atrophy, iRORA, and cRORA (AC1 = 0.53). Exploratory analyses
               suggested a significantly higher level of agreement for a
               3-category classification using (1) no atrophy; (2) presence of
               inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer subsidence, or a
               hyporeflective wedge-shaped band, as a less severe atrophic
               grade; and (3) the latter plus an additional requirement of
               choroidal hypertransmission of 250 $\mu$m or more for a more
               severe atrophic grade (AC1 = 0.68; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS:
               Assessment of iRORA and cRORA, and most of their associated
               features, can be performed relatively consistently and robustly.
               A refined combination of features to define early atrophy could

               predictions. Methods: A long-short-term memory autoencoder was
               used as the DL method to model the DA curve. The performance was
               compared against the classical nonlinear regression method using
               goodness-of-fit and repeatability metrics. Experiments were
               performed to predict the latter portion of the curve using data
               from early measurements. The prediction accuracy was quantified
               as the rod intercept time (RIT) prediction error between
               predicted and actual curves. Results: The two models had
               comparable goodness-of-fit measures, with root mean squared
               error (RMSE; SD) = 0.11 (0.04) log-units (LU) for the classical

               of the curve fits evaluated after introduction of random
               perturbations, and after performing repeated testing,
               demonstrated superiority of the DL method, especially among
               parameters related to cone decay. The DL method exhibited
               superior ability to predict the curve and RIT using points prior
               to -2 LU, with 3.1 $\pm$ 3.1 minutes RIT prediction error,
               compared to 19.1 $\pm$ 18.6 minutes RIT error for the classical

               demonstrated superior robustness as well as predictability of
               the curve. These could provide important advances in using
               multiple DA curve parameters to characterize AMD severity.
               Translational Relevance: Dark adaptation is an important

               age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. OCTA en
               face 3 $\times$ 3-mm images of the superficial and deep retinal
               layers and the choriocapillaris were acquired. Outcome
               parameters included vessel density (VD) and vessel skeleton
               density (VSD) of the superficial and deep retinal layers, as
               well as flow voids of the choriocapillaris. Results:
               Twenty-eight eyes of 17 patients and 31 age-matched control eyes
               of 18 healthy subjects were included. VD and VSD of the deep
               retinal layer were significantly reduced in hypertensive crisis
               (P $\leq$ 0.004). Choriocapillaris signal intensity was more
               heterogeneous in patients, and flow voids exhibited confluence
               with a larger average area and a lower absolute count (P $\leq$
               0.045). These changes were independent of time since onset of
               hypertensive crisis and of the presence and extent of
               retinopathy. Deep retinal changes were associated with renal
               end-organ failure (P = 0.045). Conclusions: Hypertensive crisis
               is associated with a significant reduction in retinal and
               choroidal capillary perfusion based on OCTA findings. These
               alterations are independent of retinopathy and related to
               end-organ damage. Translational Relevance: OCTA might help
               distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency
               earlier than currently possible.",

               cone-mediated dark adaptation (DA) parameters as outcome
               measures for clinical trials in age-related macular degeneration
               (AMD), including their retest reliability, association with age
               and disease severity, and measurable longitudinal change over
               time. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study
               (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01352975). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 191
               patients with AMD and older participants followed longitudinally
               over 5 years. METHODS: Dark adaptation testing was performed
               using the AdaptDx dark adaptometer with a maximum test time of
               40 minutes. A 2-part exponential-linear curve was fitted to
               obtain values for cone decay, cone plateau, time to rod-cone
               break, rod intercept time (RIT), rod adaptation rate (S2), and
               area under the curve. Intersession retest reliability was
               assessed in tests performed within 2 weeks using the
               Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship of DA parameters with
               age, AMD severity, and reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) presence was
               evaluated using linear mixed models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
               Retest reliability, association with disease severity, and
               longitudinal change of 6 DA parameters. RESULTS: A total of 1329
               DA curves were analyzed. Rod intercept time was the parameter
               that showed the greatest reliability (intraclass correlation
               coefficient of 0.88) and greatest association with age, AMD
               severity, and RPD (marginal R2 of 0.38), followed by the
               rod-mediated parameters area under the curve and rod-cone break.
               Cone plateau appeared constant at lower RIT values but increased
               with progressive rod dysfunction (RIT > 22.8 minutes) with a
               slope of 0.07 log units per 10 minutes RIT prolongation.
               Therefore, it might provide additional information in the
               advanced stages of AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related macular
               degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with
               large differences in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition,
               substantial differences in some parameters occur with age, even
               accounting for AMD severity and RPD status. This supports the
               2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and perhaps
               AMD pathophysiology itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the
               highest retest reliability, closest correlation with AMD
               severity and RPD, and largest longitudinal changes. This
               underscores the suitability of RIT as an outcome measure in
               clinical trials. The cone plateau increases only in advanced
               stages of kinetic rod dysfunction, indicating rod dysfunction
               preceding cone dysfunction and degeneration in the temporal
               sequence of pathology in AMD.",

               4-associated (ABCA4-associated) retinopathy. We aimed to
               quantify ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss and photoreceptor degeneration
               beyond EZ-loss in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and investigate
               associations between photoreceptor degeneration, genotype, and
               age.METHODSWe analyzed 132 eyes from 66 patients (of 67
               enrolled) with molecularly confirmed ABCA4-associated
               retinopathy from a prospective natural history study with a
               median [IQR] follow-up of 4.2 years [3.1, 5.1]. Longitudinal
               spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (37
               B-scans, 30° $\times$ 15°) were segmented using a deep learning
               (DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype analysis, a model of ABCA4
               variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss (6.25
               mm2) as the dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an
               average (square-root-transformed) EZ-loss progression rate of
               [95\% CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer (ONL)
               thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average
               distance from the EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL
               thickness (to $\pm$2 z score units) was 3.20° [2.53, 3.87].
               Inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thinning was less
               pronounced, with an average distance from the EZ-loss boundary
               to layer thickness normalization of 1.20° [0.91, 1.48] for the
               IS and 0.60° [0.49, 0.72] for the OS. An additive model of

               criterion EZ-loss.CONCLUSIONPatients with ABCA4-associated

               everyday clinical practice in ophthalmology since the
               introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) formula. Recent
               developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial
               intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide
               range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented
               precision. OBJECTIVE: Which criteria must be considered for the
               evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology? MATERIAL AND
               METHODS: Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous
               outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes
               (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical
               coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy
               eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested
               cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and
               hyperparameter optimization). RESULTS: Based on nested
               cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted
               in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE,
               95\% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]).
               Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test
               data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The
               exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection
               resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR
               [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting
               became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE
               (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]). CONCLUSION: Selection of an
               unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate
               validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can
               obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated
               pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.",

               deploys an age-based score to correct for lens opacification.
               However, in elderly people, lens opacification varies strongly
               between individuals of similar age, and innate lens
               autofluorescence is not included in the current correction
               formula. Our goal was to develop and compare an individualized
               formula. Methods: One hundred thirty participants were examined
               cross-sectionally, and a subset of 30 participants received
               additional multimodal imaging 2-week post-cataract-surgery.
               Imaging included the Scheimpflug principle, anterior chamber
               optical coherence tomography (AC-OCT), lens quantitative
               autofluorescence (LQAF), and retinal QAF imaging. Among the
               subset, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
               regression and backward selection was implemented to determine
               which lens score best predicts the QAF value after lens
               extraction. Subsequently, a spline mixed model was applied to
               the whole cohort to quantify the influence of LQAF and
               Scheimpflug on QAF. Results: Age and LQAF measurements were
               found to be the most relevant variables, whereas AC-OCT
               measurements and Scheimpflug were eliminated by backward
               selection. Both an increase in Scheimpflug and LQAF values were
               associated with a decrease in QAF. The prediction error of the
               spline model (mean absolute error [MAE] $\pm$ standard
               deviation) of 32.2 $\pm$ 23.4 (QAF a.u.) was markedly lower
               compared to the current age-based formula MAE of 96.1 $\pm$
               93.5. Both smooth terms, LQAF (P < 0.01) and Scheimpflug (P <
               0.001), were significant for the spline mixed model.
               Conclusions: LQAF imaging proved to be the most predictive for
               the impact of the natural lens on QAF imaging. The application
               of lens scores in the clinic could improve the accuracy of QAF
               imaging interpretation and might allow including aged patients

              This prospective, non-interventional, natural-history
              'Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy' study was conducted at
              the University Eye Hospital in Bonn, enrolling 82 patients with
              bilateral GA. Parameters such as GA location (assessed by the
              Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid), best-corrected
              visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading
              acuity, and speed were examined. The association between these
              parameters and VRQoL, as gauged using the National Eye Institute

              through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with
              linear mixed-effects models. Results: The average total GA area

              (worse eye). The VRQoL scores for distance and near activities
              were most associated with the inner lower and inner left

              all VRQoL scales. Conclusion: GA location, specifically the inner
              lower and inner left subfields of the better eye, has a notable
              effect on VRQoL in GA patients. LLVA stands out as especially

               in Stargardt disease (STGD1). METHODS: In this retrospective,
               monocentre cohort study, 271 eyes of 136 patients (age, 37.1
               years) with STGD1 and 87 eyes of 54 healthy controls (age, 41.0
               years) underwent mesopic FCP, using a pattern of 50 stimuli
               (achromatic, 400-800 nm) centred on the fovea. The concurrent
               validity of mesopic FCP testing using the MAIA device
               (CenterVue, Italy), the retest variability and its determinants,
               and the progression of sensitivity loss over time were
               investigated using mixed-model analyses. The main outcomes were
               the average pointwise sensitivity loss in dependence of
               patients' demographic, functional and imaging characteristics,
               the intrasession 95\% coefficient of repeatability, and the
               pointwise sensitivity loss over time. RESULTS: Pointwise
               sensitivity loss was on average (estimate (95\% CI)) 13.88 dB
               (12.55 to 15.21) along the horizontal meridian and was
               significantly associated with the electrophysiological subgroup,
               presence/absence of foveal sparing, best-corrected visual acuity
               and disease duration. The 95\% coefficient of repeatability was
               12.15 dB (10.78 to 13.38) and varied in dependence of the
               underlying mean sensitivity and local sensitivity slope. The
               global progression rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45
               dB/year (0.13 to 0.78) and was higher for the central and inner

              optic nerve head drusen (ONHD) and number of previous
              intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
              injections with inner retinal layer thicknesses in patients with
              pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). METHODS: In this retrospective
              case-control study, longitudinal spectral-domain optical
              coherence tomography imaging data from patients with PXE were
              compared with controls. A custom deep-learning-based segmentation
              algorithm was trained and validated to quantify the retinal nerve
              fibre layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL). The association
              of age, number of anti-VEGF injections and ONHD with the RNFL and
              GCL thickness in the outer ETDRS subfields as dependent variables
              was investigated using mixed model regression. RESULTS:
              Fourty-eight eyes of 30 patients with PXE were compared with 100
              healthy eyes. The mean age was 52.5$\pm$12.9 years (range
              21.3-68.2) for patients and 54.2$\pm$18.7 years (range 18.0-84.5)
              for controls. In patients, ONHD were visible in 15 eyes from 13
              patients and 31 eyes had received anti-VEGF injections. In the
              multivariable analysis, age (-0.10 µm/year, p<0.001), the
              diagnosis of PXE (-2.03 µm, p=0.005) and an interaction term
              between age and the presence of ONHD (-0.20 µm/year, p=0.001)
              were significantly associated with the GCL thickness. Including
              the number of intravitreal injections did not improve the model
              fit. The RNFL thickness was not significantly associated with any
              of these parameters. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates a
              significant association of ageing and ONHD with GCL thinning in
              patients with PXE, but not with the number of anti-VEGF
              injections. Given the severity of inner retinal degeneration in
              PXE, a clinical trial investigating neuroprotective therapy

               extracted along evenly spaced contour-lines surrounding areas of

               pegcetacoplan monthly had a thicker ONL along the 5.16°

               (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by
               using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. DESIGN:
               Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: A total of 41
               eyes of 41 patients (75.8 $\pm$ 8.4 years old; 22 females) from
               a tertiary referral hospital were included. Mesopic,
               dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were assessed by
               using fundus-controlled perimetry (``microperimetry''); and
               retinal microstructure was assessed by using spectral-domain
               optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence
               (FAF), and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer
               thicknesses and intensities and FAF and IR intensities were
               extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean absolute
               error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of
               retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training
               data and percentage of increased mean-squared error (\%IncMSE)
               as measurement of feature importance. RESULTS: Retinal
               sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic,
               4.89 dB for DA cyan, and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the
               absence of patient-specific data. Partial addition of
               patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased
               the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of
               testing, the outer nuclear layer thickness constituted the most
               important predictive feature (35.0, 42.22, and 53.74 \%IncMSE).
               Spatially resolved mapping of ``inferred sensitivity'' revealed
               regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan

               atrophy lesion size in ABCA4-related retinopathy using green
               (GAF) and blue fundus autofluorescence (BAF) imaging. METHODS:
               In this cross-sectional case series, 97 eyes of 49 patients with
               RPE atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy underwent
               GAF- (518 nm excitation light) and BAF- (488 nm excitation
               light) imaging using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
               (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany).
               Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and
               questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF
               imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers
               using semiautomated software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg
               Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were
               assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and
               circularity. RESULTS: GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF
               and QDAF showed high intermodality and interreader agreement
               concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive
               parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of
               square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly
               higher for GAF-based grading ([95\% coefficients of
               repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215
               mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading
               (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However,
               DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results
               than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with
               intermodality agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Both GAF- and BAF-based
               quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable results with
               possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic
               excitation light. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The high interreader
               agreement qualifies the use of DDAF progression in GAF and BAF

               Patients with foveal-sparing GA secondary to age-related macular
               degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Monocular best-corrected visual
               acuity and reading acuity together with reading speed were
               assessed using Radner charts. Fundus autofluorescence,
               near-infrared reflectance, and spectral-domain OCT images were
               acquired using a Spectralis device. The minimal required reading
               rectangle (M3R), 19 letters $\times$ 2.4 lines in the smallest
               readable print size of an individual eye, was computed. The
               status of the M3R was determined as either free of atrophy or
               involved in the atrophic process, and the impact on reading was
               assessed. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Radner reading score (logRAD)
               and reading speed (words per minute [wpm]). RESULTS: A total of
               45 eyes of 31 patients (30 women; mean age, 76.14 years [range,
               64.17-89.22 years]) were included. Median best-corrected visual
               acuity was 0.20 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution
               (logMAR; Snellen equivalent, 20/32). Reading score was 0.52
               logRAD (IQR, 0.30-1.4 logRAD) and maximum reading speed was
               141.19 wpm (IQR, 105.52-164.62 wpm). In 27 eyes, the M3R was
               involved in the atrophic process. This was associated with a
               significant worsening in Radner score (1.21 logRAD [IQR,
               0.46-1.40 logRAD] vs. 0.31 logRAD [IQR, 0.20-0.51 logRAD]; P <

               162.34 wpm [IQR, 137.51-176.66 wpm]; P = 0.002). Eyes in which
               the M3R was nonatrophic additionally showed an increase in
               reading speed with decreasing print size (peak increase, +73.08
               wpm [IQR, 27.43-86.64 wpm] compared with the largest test
               sentence). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that a defined area
               on the retina that can be assessed by retinal imaging is
               required for unhindered reading in patients with foveal-sparing

               read faster by patients with this AMD subphenotype. Our results

               and 12 weeks included scotopic thresholds, dark adaptation,
               best-corrected and low luminance visual acuities, and the
               low-luminance quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: In the
               linear mixed model, rod intercept time improved significantly in
               the AMD group (mean [95\% CI] change -1.1 minutes [-1.8; -0.5]
               after 4 weeks ( P < 0.001) and -2.2 min [-2.9 to -1.6] after 8
               weeks of vitamin A supplementation ( P < 0.001). The dark
               adaptation cone plateau also significantly improved (i.e., more
               sensitive cone threshold) at 4 and 8 weeks ( P = 0.026 and P =
               0.001). No other parameters improved in the AMD group, and there
               was no significant improvement in any parameter in the RPD group
               despite significantly elevated serum vitamin A levels measurable
               in both groups after supplementation ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.013).
               CONCLUSION: Supplementation with 16,000 IU vitamin A, a lower
               dose than used in previous studies, partially overcomes the
               pathophysiologic functional changes in AMD eyes. The lack of
               improvement in the RPD group may indicate structural impediments
               to increasing vitamin A availability in these patients and/or
               may reflect the higher variability observed in the functional
               parameters for this group.",

               retinal imaging, functional testing, and targeted
               next-generation sequencing. A considerable intrafamilial
               phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity was identified. While the
               parents of the index family presented with rod-cone dystrophy
               and ABCA4-related retinopathy, their two sons revealed
               characteristics in the spectrum of incomplete congenital

               Molecular testing revealed previously described variants in RHO,

               and neovascularization on optical coherence tomography followed
               optical coherence tomography angiography-based criteria. Eyes
               were graded for the presence of hyperreflectivity and
               neovascularization and further categorized into three classes
               based on position and extent of hyperreflectivity. In a
               secondary analysis, eyes were reviewed for $\geq$24 months using
               optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS: Three hundred and
               twenty-two eyes from 161 patients were analyzed in the
               cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177
               (55\%) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15\%) eyes.
               Hyperreflectivity correlated significantly with parameters
               indicative of disease progression. In the longitudinal analysis,
               206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of 35.6
               months. 17/86 eyes (20\%) showed a de novo development of

               finding in macular telangiectasia Type 2 but lacks a uniform
               definition. We propose a hyperreflectivity grading scale that

               secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: In
               a retrospective analysis, eyes with NVs secondary to MacTel were
               reviewed over a period of $\geq$8 months. Examinations at
               monthly intervals included visual acuity testing, dilated
               funduscopy, spectral domain-OCT and OCT-A. Eyes were treated
               with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
               factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and
               treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of
               activity as determined by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of
               neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal
               thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid
               and haemorrhages. RESULTS: A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients
               were analysed. Patients were evaluated over a mean period of
               13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted the monitoring
               of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth)
               of NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular
               vessels was detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity
               occurred on OCT. NVs showed a progressive growth over time

               Amish population with age-related macular degeneration (AMD).
               PATIENTS AND METHODS: Mesopic and scotopic microperimetric
               testing was performed in 148 eyes of 77 elderly Amish subjects
               (age > 50 years) from Pennsylvania using a retinal function
               analyzer. Scotopic testing was performed using a 2.0 log unit
               neutral density filter following 30 minutes of dark adaptation.
               All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations,
               including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus
               autofluorescence, infrared reflectance imaging, and flash color
               fundus photography. Certified graders at Doheny Image Reading
               Center identified subjects with evidence of AMD as defined by
               the Beckman classification and quantified drusen volume. RS in
               subjects with and without AMD was compared. Correlations between
               RS and drusen burden were analyzed. Ten eyes with incomplete
               MP-1S exams were excluded from the final analysis. RESULTS:
               Among the 138 eyes from 77 subjects included in the final
               analysis, 42 eyes from 29 subjects had evidence of early or
               intermediate AMD. The mean age of subjects with AMD was 69.65
               years $\pm$ 13.81 years versus 63.04 years $\pm$ 12.69 years in
               those without AMD (P = .06). Mesopic RS was 18.8 dB $\pm$ 2.1 dB
               in subjects with AMD and 19.6 dB $\pm$ 1.4 dB in those without
               AMD (P = .07). Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in
               subjects with AMD (15.9 dB $\pm$ 2.9 dB) compared with those
               without AMD (17.3 dB $\pm$ 2.4 dB). There was no relationship
               between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r = -0.06; P = .32)
               or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an
               association between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39;
               P = .24) and drusen volume (r = -0.36; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS: In
               an elderly Amish population, eyes with early or intermediate AMD
               show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than mesopic RS,
               suggesting that rod function is more severely affected than cone
               function. Drusen area and volume measurements better correlated

               METHODS: In this retrospective study, eyes with a minimum
               observation period of 6 months prior to the de novo diagnosis of
               an exudative neovascularisation secondary to MacTel were

               neovascularisation were evaluated using colour fundus
               photography, infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular
               pigment measurement and optical coherence tomography (OCT).
               OCT-angiography (OCT-A) images were additionally available in a
               subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eyes from 20 patients were
               examined over a median period of 17 months (range: 6-100
               months). Eyes were characterised by an accelerated progression
               of ellipsoid zone loss (median of 0.013 mm2/month), increased
               thickness of the temporal parafovea and hyper-reflective lesions

               increase in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal
               layers and the retinal pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a
               foveal depletion of macular pigment. On OCT-A, a focal increase
               in blood flow was observed at the level of the outer
               retina/choriocapillaris, and retinal-retinal and
               retinal-choroidal anastomoses preceded the formation of
               exudative neovascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal imaging
               allows the identification of prognostic morphological features
               preceding the formation of exudative neovascularisation in
               MacTel. Eyes exhibiting these characteristics should be
               monitored closely and patients should be alert for emergent
               symptoms in order to detect and treat neovascularisation early
               and, thereby, prevent irreversible visual loss.",

               with drusen, age 69.4 $\pm$ 12.6 years; 20 normal eyes of 16
               subjects, 61.7 $\pm$ 12.4 years) underwent duplicate mesopic,
               dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red FCP within 14° of the
               central retina (total of 12 936 threshold tests) using the
               Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment (S-MAIA, CenterVue,
               Padova, Italy) device. FCP data were registered to SD-OCT data
               to obtain outer nuclear layer, inner and outer photoreceptor
               segment, and retinal pigment epithelium drusen complex (RPEDC)
               thickness data spatially corresponding to the stimulus location

               mesopic (-2.1, -3.4, and -3.6 dB) and dark-adapted red (-1.4,
               -2.6, and -3.3 dB) FCP. For the dark-adapted cyan FCP (0.1,
               -1.9, and -5.0 dB) and for the cyan-red sensitivity difference
               (+1.0, +0.5, and -2.4 dB), the mean deviation values differed
               significantly in dependence of the predominant drusen type
               (one-way ANOVA; p < 0.05). RPEDC thickness was associated with
               reduction of mesopic sensitivity (-0.34 dB/10 µm RPEDC
               thickening; p < 0.001), dark-adapted cyan sensitivity (-0.11

               sensitivity (-0.26 dB/10 µm RPEDC thickening; p < 0.001).
               CONCLUSIONS: In contrast to mesopic FCP, dark-adapted two-color
               FCP allowed for meaningful differential testing of rod and cone
               function in patients with drusen indicating predominant cone
               dysfunction in eyes with cuticular drusen and predominant rod
               dysfunction in eyes with reticular drusen. RPEDC thickness was

              and 6 degrees eccentricity). Following a brief break
              (approximately 5 minutes), the participants were bleached again
              and underwent dark-adaptometry testing with the S-MAIA device
              (same loci). In the retest reliability-substudy, participants
              were tested twice with the S-MAIA device (same loci as above).
              Nonlinear curve fitting was applied to extract dark-adaptation
              curve parameters. Validity and repeatability were summarized in
              terms of the mean bias and 95\% limits of agreement (LoAs).
              Results: In the validation-substudy (N = 20 participants, median
              age interquartile range [IQR] 31.5 years [IQR = 25.8, 62.0]),
              measures of rod-mediated dark-adaptation showed little to no
              between method differences for the cone-rod-break-time (bias 95\%
              confidence interval [95\% CI] of +0.1 minutes [95\% CI = -0.6 to
              0.8]), rod-intercept-time (-0.23 minutes [95\% CI = -1.38 to
              0.93]), and S2 slope (-0.01 LogUnits/minutes [95\% CI = -0.02 to
              -0.01]). In the retest reliability-substudy (N = 10 participants,
              32.0 years [95\% CI = 27.0, 57.5]), the corresponding LoAs were
              (cone-rod-break-time) -3.94 to 2.78 minutes, (rod-intercept-time)
              -4.55 to 3.11 minutes, and (S2 slope [rate-limited component of
              rod recovery]) -0.03 to 0.03 LogUnits/minutes. The LoAs for the
              steady-state cone and rod thresholds were -0.28 to 0.33 LogUnits
              and -0.34 to 0.28 LogUnits. Conclusions: The devised
              fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry method yields valid and
              reliable results. Translational Relevance: Fundus-controlled

  abstract  = "Purpose: Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral
               neurodegenerative disorder of the central macula. Previous
               findings indicated more functional impairment in low light
               conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal
               dysfunction using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled
               perimetry (``scotopic microperimetry''). Methods: Participants
               of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and
               age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including
               dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density
               (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with
               scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm).
               Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For
               perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities
               (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and
               the results were aggregated to global indices. Results:
               Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were
               compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both
               cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more
               pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD
               class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had
               impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved
               similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a
               relatively higher cyan impairment. Conclusions: Rods might be
               compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous
               studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral)
               dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages.
               Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to
               reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct
               measures for disease progression.",

               age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) and predominantly
               reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). Methods: At baseline 30 eyes of 25
               iAMD patients underwent optical coherence tomography imaging,
               mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) with
               follow-up examinations at month 12 (20 eyes), 24 (12 eyes), and
               36 (11 eyes). Thicknesses of different retinal layers and
               results of FCP testing (n = 56 stimuli) were spatially and
               longitudinally analyzed using linear mixed-effects models.
               Results: At baseline, the thickness of the partial outer retinal
               layer (pORL, 70.21 vs. 77.47 µm) and both mesopic (16.60 vs.
               18.72 dB) and scotopic (12.14 vs. 18.67 dB) retinal sensitivity
               were decreased in areas with RPD compared with unremarkable
               areas (P < 0.001). Over three years, mean change of pORL was
               -0.66 normative standard deviation (SD; i.e., z-score, P <
               0.001) for regions with existing RPD, -0.40 SD (P < 0.001) for
               regions with new occurring RPD, and -0.17 SD (P = 0.041) in
               unremarkable regions. Decrease of scotopic and mesopic
               sensitivity over three years was more pronounced in areas with
               existing (-3.51 and -7.76 dB) and new occurring RPD (-2.06 and
               -5.97 dB). Structure-function analysis revealed that 1 SD
               decrease of pORL thickness was associated with a sensitivity
               reduction of 3.47 dB in scotopic and 0.79 dB in mesopic testing.
               Conclusions: This study demonstrates progressive outer retinal
               degeneration and impairment of photoreceptor function in eyes
               with iAMD and RPD over three years. Preservation of outer

               cause of irreversible vision loss among individuals older than
               50 years. Although considerable advances have been made in our
               understanding of AMD genetics, the differential effects of major
               associated loci on disease manifestation and progression may not
               be well characterized. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the specific
               associations of the 2 most common genetic risk loci for AMD, the
               CFH-CFHR5 locus on chromosome 1q32 (Chr1) and the ARMS2/HTRA1
               locus on chromosome 10q26 (Chr10)-independent of one another and
               in combination-with time to conversion to late-stage disease and
               to visual acuity loss. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This
               case series study included 502 individuals who were homozygous
               for risk variants at both Chr1 and Chr10 (termed Chr1\&10-risk)
               or at either Chr1 (Chr1-risk) or Chr10 (Chr10-risk) and who had
               enrolled in Genetic and Molecular Studies of Eye Diseases at the
               Sharon Eccles Steele Center for Translational Medicine between
               September 2009 and March 2020. Multimodal imaging data were
               reviewed for AMD staging, including grading of incomplete and
               complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy.
               MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios and survival times for
               conversion to any late-stage AMD, atrophic or neovascular, and
               associated vision loss of 2 or more lines. RESULTS: In total,
               317 participants in the Chr1-risk group (median [IQR] age at
               first visit, 75.6 [69.5-81.7] years; 193 women [60.9\%]), 93
               participants in the Chr10-risk group (median [IQR] age at first
               visit, 77.5 [72.2-84.2] years; 62 women [66.7\%]), and 92
               participants in the Chr1\&10-risk group (median [IQR] age at
               first visit, 71.7 [68.0-76.3] years; 62 women [67.4\%]) were
               included in the analyses. After adjusting for age and AMD grade
               at first visit, compared with 257 participants in the Chr1-risk
               group, 56 participants in the Chr1\&10-risk group (factor of 3.3
               [95\% CI, 1.6-6.8]; P < .001) and 58 participants in the
               Chr10-risk group (factor of 2.6 [95\% CI, 1.3-5.2]; P = .007)
               were more likely to convert to a late-stage phenotype during
               follow-up. This difference was mostly associated with conversion
               to macular neovascularization, which occurred earlier in
               participants with Chr1\&10-risk and Chr10-risk. Eyes in the
               Chr1\&10-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 5.7 [2.1-11.1]
               years) were 2.1 (95\% CI, 1.1-3.9; P = .03) times as likely and
               eyes in the Chr10-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 6.3
               [2.7-11.3] years) were 1.8 (95\% CI, 1.0-3.1; P = .05) times as
               likely to experience a visual acuity loss of 2 or more lines
               compared with eyes of the Chr1-risk group (median [IQR]
               survival, 9.4 [4.1-* (asterisk indicates event rate did not
               reach 75\%)] years). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings
               suggest differential associations of the 2 major AMD-related
               risk loci with structural and functional disease progression and
               suggest distinct underlying biological mechanisms associated
               with these 2 loci. These genotype-phenotype associations may
               warrant consideration when designing and interpreting AMD

               near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a

               Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent

               thickness, and changes over time. DESIGN: Longitudinal, cohort
               study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five participants with RPD and
               spectrum of AMD severity (including no AMD). METHODS: Multimodal
               imaging was graded by a reading center, including evaluation of
               color fundus imaging to assess AMD severity scores. Reticular
               pseudodrusen presence on OCT volumes was confirmed on en face
               imaging and the RPD extent was contoured on infrared images. One
               study eye per participant underwent rod-mediated dark
               adaptation, measuring rod intercept time (RIT) at 5° and, if
               needed, 12° superior to the fovea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
               primary outcome was RIT and OCT thickness measures which were
               correlated with RPD area. RESULTS: A total of 51 eyes had $\geq$

               atrophy and 17 (33.3\%) progressed to neovascular AMD. Larger
               RPD areas were detected more frequently in AMD severity scores

               12° (P = 0.004; r2 = 0.01). Rod-mediated dark adaptation at 5°
               reached the test ceiling in > 85\% of visits, irrespective of
               RPD lesion presence/absence at the test location. Retinal
               thickness decreased monotonically, with the central subfield
               demonstrating the greatest percentage change over 5 years
               ($\Delta$ = -5.47\%). CONCLUSIONS: In AMD, RPD involve
               predominantly the superior retina but can involve all ETDRS
               subfields and evolve over time. Eyes with RPD exhibit structural
               and functional impairments that can be measured beyond the
               boundaries of the RPD lesions, suggesting changes associated
               with RPD are associated with both local changes and a more
               widespread process. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: Proprietary or

               eyes (23 STGD1 and 20 AMD) of patients with RPE atrophy and 25
               eyes of healthy controls without ocular pathology underwent

               structural and functional parameters influence the
               vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in patients suffering
               from geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular
               degeneration. DESIGN: This study was designed as a prospective,
               noninterventional, natural-history study (Directional Spread in
               Geographic-Atrophy study, NCT02051998). SUBJECTS: The research
               involved 82 patients with bilateral GA. METHODS: The study
               examined parameters including GA location as assessed by the
               ETDRS grid, best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual
               acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed. These parameters were
               then correlated with VRQoL, which was gauged using the National
               Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25. The analysis
               method employed was the least absolute shrinkage and selection
               operator with linear mixed-effects models. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES: The central parameters measured in this study
               encompassed GA area, VRQoL scores associated with different GA
               subfields, and the significance of LLVA for foveal-sparing
               patients. RESULTS: On average, patients showed a total GA area
               of 2.9 $\pm$ 1.2 mm2 in the better eye (BE) and 3.1 $\pm$ 1.3
               mm2 in the worse eye. The most significant associations with
               VRQoL scores for distance and near activities were observed in
               the inner lower and inner left subfields of the BE,
               respectively. For patients with foveal-sparing GA, the LLVA of
               the BE stood out as the most influential variable across all
               VRQoL scales. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings point toward the
               pivotal role of GA location, especially the inner lower and
               inner left subfields of the BE, in relation to VRQoL in GA
               patients. The LLVA's importance becomes even more pronounced for
               foveal-sparing patients. These observations highlight the need
               for health care professionals to better understand the
               association between lesion location and patient-reported
               outcomes. This is critical for informing treatment decisions and

               (AS), a rare monogenetic disease due to mutations in genes
               encoding for collagen type IV. Methods: Twenty-eight eyes of
               nine patients with AS, and five autosomal-recessive carriers and
               15 eyes from 15 age-similar healthy control subjects were
               examined using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and
               OCT-angiography (OCT-A). Foveal configuration and FAZ measures
               including the FAZ area, circularity, and vessel density in the
               central 1° and 3° were correlated. Results: Foveal hypoplasia
               was found in 10 eyes from seven patients with either genotype.
               In contrast, a staircase foveopathy was found in seven eyes of
               four X-linked AS patients. The average FAZ area did not differ
               significantly between AS patients and control subjects (mean
               $\pm$ SD 0.24 $\pm$ 0.24 mm2 vs. 0.21 $\pm$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.64).
               Five eyes showed absence or severe anomalies of the FAZ with
               crossing macular capillaries that was linked to the degree of
               foveal hypoplasia on OCT images leading to a significant inverse
               correlation of FAZ area and foveal thickness (r = -0.88; P <
               0.001). In contrary, female patients with X-linked mutations
               exhibited a significantly greater FAZ area (0.48 $\pm$ 0.30 mm2
               vs. 0.21 $\pm$ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.007), in line with OCT findings
               of a staircase foveopathy. Conclusions: The foveal phenotypic
               spectrum in AS ranges from foveal hypoplasia and absence of a
               FAZ to staircase foveopathy with an enlarged FAZ. Because the
               development of the FAZ and foveal pit are closely related, these
               findings suggest an important role for collagen type IV in

               require suitable end points. The characterization and validation
               of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is
               warranted. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate reading
               performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association
               with established visual function assessments and structural
               biomarkers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The

               geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the
               University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled
               from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and
               ended January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reading acuity
               and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts.
               Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance
               images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy,
               followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear
               mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association
               of those variables with reading performance. RESULTS: A total of
               150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this study (median
               [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60\%]; 34 men
               [40\%]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR)
               monocular reading acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the
               reading acuity determination and a reading speed of 52.8 (0-123)
               words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis,
               best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the
               central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)
               subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving
               geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the
               inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest associations with
               reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity = 0.69).
               Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were
               best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area
               of geographic atrophy in the central ETDRS subfield, in the
               inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS
               subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal
               analysis, a similar prediction accuracy for reading performance
               was determined (R2 for reading acuity = 0.73; R2 for reading
               speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when
               follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular
               reading performance did not differ from reading performance in
               the better-seeing eye. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The
               association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional
               and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading
               performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These
               findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care
               for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on
               the better-seeing eye.",

              after uncomplicated vitrectomy for epiretinal gliosis or
              phacoemulsification (group 1: 12 eyes) or secondary to
              noninfectious endogenous uveitis (group 2: 36 eyes). Central
              retinal thickness (CRT), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA,
              logMAR), and intraocular pressure (IOP) throughout follow-up were
              gleaned from the medical records. RESULTS: In group 1, CRT
              decreased, compared with baseline, from 519 $\pm$ 43 to 297 $\pm$
              23 and 356 $\pm$ 49 $\mu$m by the 1- and 3-month visit (P = 0.02)
              and to 429 $\pm$ 57 $\mu$m before reimplantation. In group 2, CRT
              decreased from 460 $\pm$ 31 to 300 $\pm$ 21 and 312 $\pm$ 26
              $\mu$m by the 1- and 3-month follow-up, respectively (P = 0.001),
              and to 373 $\pm$ 32 $\mu$m before reimplantation. Complete
              resolution of CME was achieved in 67\% and 94\% (groups 1 and 2,
              respectively) by 1 month and in 42\% and 80\% by 3 months after
              injection. In group 1, BCVA improved from 0.46 $\pm$ 0.08 to 0.27
              $\pm$ 0.09 and 0.20 $\pm$ 0.06 (P = 0.01) by the 1- and 3-month
              follow-up, respectively, and to 0.32 $\pm$ 0.08 before
              reimplantation. In group 2, BCVA improved from 0.47 $\pm$ 0.06 to
              0.34 $\pm$ 0.09, 0.26 $\pm$ 0.07, and 0.29 $\pm$ 0.08 (P < 0.05)
              at 1 and 3 months of follow-up and before reimplantation,
              respectively. A significant IOP increase was not observed in
              either group. Mean time to reimplantation of Ozurdex was 6.4
              $\pm$ 5.7 and 6.6 $\pm$ 3.4 months for postoperative and uveitic
              CME, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ozurdex seems to achieve a
              sustained effect over up to 6 months in postsurgical and uveitic
              CME.",

               drusen detection and differences between modalities were
               assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and
               mean difference in a 5 mm diameter fovea-centered circle.
               Specificity was > 90\% in the three modalities. In eAMD, we
               observed highest sensitivity in the denser Spectralis scan
               (68.1). The two different Spectralis modalities showed a
               significantly higher agreement in quantifying drusen volume in
               iAMD (ICC 0.993 [0.991-0.994]) than the dense Spectralis with
               Cirrus scan (ICC 0.807 [0.757-0.847]). Formulae for drusen
               volume conversion in iAMD between the two devices are provided.
               Automated drusen volume measures are not interchangeable between
               devices and softwares and need to be interpreted with the used

              study, each of the 52 eyes of 52 subjects with various macular
              diseases (mean age 62.0 $\pm$ 16.9 years; range, 19.1-90.1 years)
              underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm),

              METHODS: This retrospective interventional study involved 47
              DME-afflicted eyes, which were administered $\geq$2 intravitreal
              injections of dexamethasone. Group 1 (34 eyes) received a

              combination therapy with intravitreal antivascular endothelial
              growth factor as needed. The duration of dexamethasone effect

              during a mean follow-up of 23 $\pm$ 10 and 24 $\pm$ 13 months,

              1) and 5.3 $\pm$ 1.0 months (group 2; P = 0.17). Reinjection
              intervals did not shorten over time for up to 10 dexamethasone
              injections per eye in group 1 and BCVA improved from before 1
              month after the first implantation, 7.0 letters (P = 0.04). In
              group 2, there was no significant improvement in BCVA at any time

              long-term anatomic and functional improvement. The absence of a

               age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: Prospective,
               longitudinal natural history study. PARTICIPANTS: Fifty-nine
               eyes of 54 patients with large drusen (> 125 $\mu$m) associated
               with iAMD and 27 age-matched healthy control eyes. METHODS:
               Participants underwent spectral-domain OCT and both mesopic and
               scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP). Annual follow-up
               visits were performed over a 3-year period. MAIN OUTCOME
               MEASURES: Pointwise correlation of retinal sensitivity stimuli
               to corresponding standardized (Z score) pointwise retinal
               thickness. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to analyze
               longitudinally the association of pointwise retinal thickness
               changes, follow-up time, or both with retinal function. RESULTS:
               At baseline, mean pointwise sensitivity in patients was reduced
               by -1.67 dB (95\% confidence interval [CI], -2.22 to -1.12) for
               mesopic and by -2.34 dB (95\% CI, -2.85 to -1.84) for scotopic
               testing compared with controls with a pointwise sensitivity
               change of -0.35 dB/year (95\% CI, -0.43 to -0.28) for mesopic
               and +0.20 dB/year (95\% CI, 0.12-0.29) for scotopic testing,
               respectively (P < 0.001). Retinal thickness analysis in patients
               revealed a significantly thinner outer nuclear layer (ONL) by
               -0.49 standard deviation (SD; 95\% CI, -0.70 to -0.28 SD) and a
               significant thicker retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex
               (RPEDC) by +3.22 SD (95\% CI, 2.27-4.17 SD) at baseline,
               respectively (P < 0.001). During follow-up, retinal thickness
               thickened further by +0.51 SD/year (RPEDC) and thinned by -0.03
               SD/year (ONL; P = 0.045) and -0.34 SD/year (inner and outer
               photoreceptor segments) in patients, respectively (P < 0.001).
               Structure-function analysis showed a significant association of
               the ONL and the RPEDC thickness change with both types of FCP
               sensitivity testing (P < 0.001). Besides, follow-up time had a
               significant (independent) effect on mesopic and scotopic retinal
               sensitivity (P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The longitudinal
               structure-function correlation demonstrated a progressive
               quantifiable degeneration of the outer retina in iAMD associated
               with photoreceptor dysfunction. Because longitudinal sensitivity
               changes could not be explained by structural changes alone, an
               unmet need remains for additional refined parameters on retinal
               structure to predict retinal function.",

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To determine the retest variability of mesopic and
               two-color dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP),
               to evaluate the predictive value of patient reliability indices,
               and to analyze the extent of impairment of rod- and cone
               function in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).
               METHODS: A total of 50 eyes of 50 patients with nAMD (mean age,
               76.1 years) and 70 eyes of 70 age-similar normal subjects
               underwent multimodal imaging as well as mesopic and DA two-color
               perimetry using the S-MAIA device. A subset of patients (n = 28)
               underwent duplicate testing for retest reliability assessment.
               Mixed models were used for analysis of the hierarchical data.
               RESULTS: In eyes with nAMD, the coefficient of repeatability was
               (mean $\pm$ standard deviation [SD]) 5.99 $\pm$ 1.55 dB for
               mesopic, 6.14 $\pm$ 2.19 dB for DA cyan, and 6.06 $\pm$ 1.09 dB
               for DA red testing. ``Patient reliability indices'' explained
               55\%, 54.2\%, and 64.2\% of the variance in retest variability.
               The mean sensitivity loss was greater for DA cyan compared to DA
               red testing (cyan-red differences [mean $\pm$ SD] -2.63 $\pm$
               3.87 dB, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively greater degree
               of DA cyan versus DA red sensitivity loss indicates preferential
               rod vulnerability in nAMD, and qualifies rod function-based
               outcomes measures as potential sensitive and early markers of
               treatment response in nAMD. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE: The S-MAIA
               allows reliable testing of mesopic, DA cyan, and DA red
               sensitivity in patients with nAMD. Patient reliability indices
               may serve as eligibility criteria for clinical trials to
               identify patients with adequate retest reliability.",

               in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by
               building a suitable statistical regression model for GA size
               measurements obtained from fundus autofluorescence imaging.
               METHODS: Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a
               linear mixed-effects model for GA size progression that
               incorporates covariable-dependent enlargement rates as well as
               correlations between longitudinally collected GA size
               measurements. To capture nonlinear progression in a flexible
               way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with
               different transformation parameters $\lambda$. Model evaluation
               is performed on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective
               multi-center cohort studies on GA size progression. RESULTS: A
               transformation parameter of $\lambda$=0.45 yielded the best
               model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When
               hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were included as risk
               factors in the model, they showed an association with
               progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this
               model was 67.21$\pm$6.49 years. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a
               comprehensive framework for modeling the course of uni- or
               bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal observational
               studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset
               estimation, identification of risk factors and prediction of
               future GA size. A square-root transformation of atrophy size is
               recommended before model fitting.",

               Methods: Mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red light
               sensitivity (Goldmann III) were investigated using
               fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry). Test points were
               placed within GA along an ``iso-hull'' with a distance of
               -0.645° to the atrophy boundary. The false-positive response
               rate was determined with suprathreshold stimuli to the optic
               disc (Heijl-Krakau method) and used to compute the expected
               sensitivity measurements for the assumption of absolute
               scotomata. The outermost visible retinal layer on
               spectral-domain optical coherence tomography at the location of
               each test point was determined. Results: Thirty eyes of 36
               patients (75.55 $\pm$ 7.93 years; 19 female) from the
               prospective natural history study Directional Spread in
               Geographic Atrophy (NCT02051998), with a total of 1380 threshold
               determinations were analyzed. The measured sensitivities were
               significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the expected values for
               absolute scotomata (mean $\pm$ standard error of +6.92 $\pm$
               0.86 dB for mesopic, +2.57 $\pm$ 0.56 dB for DA cyan, and +4.93
               $\pm$ 0.74 dB for DA red testing). For mesopic testing and DA
               red testing, the presence of a residual outer nuclear layer had
               a significant effect on this discrepancy (P < 0.001). There was
               no effect of fixation stability or any other reliability index
               on this discrepancy. Conclusions: Measured sensitivities within
               the inner junctional zone of GA may not be purely explained by
               patient-specific false-positive response rates or other
               reliability indices. The marked influence of the outer retinal
               configuration on measured sensitivity may be indicative of
               residual cone function within GA at the inner junctional zone.",

               context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at
               the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany.
               PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59
               patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean ($\pm$standard
               deviation) age at baseline of 76.60$\pm$6.65 years and median
               (interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55)
               were included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on
               multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment
               epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-na{\"\i}ve quiescent CNV
               (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and
               RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81). METHODS:
               Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis
               of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance
               images. If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its
               location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The
               localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to
               the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic
               regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between
               predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to
               estimate the model accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio
               (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying
               type 1 CNV. RESULTS: The prediction model achieved a high
               overlap between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression
               with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95\% confidence
               interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds
               for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of
               0.21 (95\% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of
               treatment-na{\"\i}ve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of
               0.46 (95\% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1
               CNV. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is markedly
               reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with
               quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is
               compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on
               the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may
               have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV

              (OCTA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, noncomparative
              case series, 3 mm $\times$ 3 mm OCTA images of 36 eyes of 22
              healthy individuals were obtained using a swept-source
              instrument. VD and GV levels were calculated on CC en face slabs
              in the central 1-mm (subfoveal field) and surrounding 2.5-mm
              parafoveal ring. VD was calculated as a ratio of vessel area over
              nonvessel area following image binarization. GV was computed as
              the mean, un-normalized greyscale intensity value for all pixels
              in the region of interest. For each eye, the procedure was
              repeated 1 minute to 2 minutes later and intersession
              repeatability was analyzed. The choroidal thickness (CT) was
              automatically measured in the subfoveal and parafoveal regions
              and compared to VD and GV values. RESULTS: The VD ratio and GV
              was lower in the subfoveal field than in the parafoveal four

              Quantitative metrics can be obtained from CC OCTA en face images.

               Avanti\textregistered{} RTVue 100 XR system (Optovue Inc.,
               Fremont, Calif., USA). The borders of the superficial vascular

  abstract  = "INTRODUCTION: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic
               correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem
               tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the
               establishment of an eye donation registry represents a
               prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. METHODS: A total
               of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center
               in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary
               questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions
               (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median
               and 25th (Q25) and 75th (Q75) percentiles. RESULTS: The majority
               of patients (77.0\%) would agree to donate their eyes for
               research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye
               donation, 60.9\% of all patients only stated reasons in the
               category ``addressable'' (e.g., not enough awareness of the
               topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate
               for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of
               postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1). CONCLUSION:
               Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye
               donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given
               against postmortem eye donation were often related to
               misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results
               underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological
               patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research
               purposes.",

               degeneration using patient-tailored perimetry grids for mesopic
               and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry. METHODS:
               Twenty-five eyes with GA of 25 patients (prospective,
               natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study
               [DSGA; NCT02051998]) and 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects were
               included. Patient-tailored perimetry grids were generated using
               annotated fundus autofluorescence data. Customized software
               positioned test-points along iso-hulls surrounding the GA
               boundary at distances of 0.43°, 0.86°, 1.29°, 2.15°, and 3.01°.
               The grids were used for duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted
               two-color (cyan and red) fundus-controlled perimetry.
               Age-adjusted reference-data were obtained through regression
               analysis of normative data followed by spatial interpolation.
               RESULTS: The mean sensitivity loss for mesopic testing decreased
               with the distance to GA (-10.3 dB [0.43°], -8.2 dB [0.86°], -7.1
               dB [1.29°], -6.8 dB [2.15°], and -6.6 dB [3.01°]; P < 0.01).
               Dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss exceeded dark-adapted red
               sensitivity loss for all iso-hulls (-14.8 vs. -11.7 dB, -13.5
               vs. -10.1 dB, -12.8 vs. -9.1 dB, -11.6 vs. -8.2 dB, -10.7 vs.
               -8.0 dB; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Patient-tailored
               fundus-controlled perimetry grids allowed for testing of retinal
               function in the junctional zone of GA with high spatial
               resolution. A distinct decrease in mesopic sensitivity loss
               between 0.43° (125 µm) and 1.29° (375 µm) was observed that
               leveled off at more distant test-points. In proximity to the GA

               lesions in eyes with intermediate (i) AMD on the subsequent GA
               progression. METHODS: Structural precursor lesions for atrophic
               areas (lesion size at least 0.5 mm² in fundus autofluorescence
               images) were retrospectively identified based on multimodal
               imaging and evaluated for association with the subsequent GA
               enlargement rates (square-root transformed, sqrt). A linear
               mixed-effects model was used to account for the hierarchical
               nature of the data with a Tukey post hoc test to assess the
               impact of the local precursor on the subsequent GA progression
               rate. RESULTS: A total of 39 eyes with GA of 34 patients with a
               mean age of 74.4$\pm$6.7 ($\pm$SD) years were included in this
               study. Five precursor lesions (phenotypes 1-5) preceding GA
               development were identified: large, sub-retinal pigment
               epithelial drusen (n=19), reticular pseudodrusen (RPD, n=10),
               refractile deposits (n=4), pigment epithelial detachment (n=4)

              interreader agreement, the extent of the neovascular network was
              further measured on fluorescein angiography (FA) images. Results:
              A total of 31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5 years, 15 female)
              were included in the study. Neovascularization subtype was

               with radial frequency arcs presented at 4 loci: $\pm$4 degrees
               and 8 degrees vertical eccentricity. Scotopic thresholds and
               dark adaptation (DA) were measured at the same loci. Retinal
               layers of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)

               Results: The iAMD group had significantly worse sCDD thresholds
               compared with controls (8 degrees inferior retina: P = 0.004 and
               the 4 degrees loci: P < 0.02 for both). Elevated sCDD thresholds
               were observed in iAMD and RPD eyes at loci with normal scotopic
               thresholds; the opposite was rarely encountered. Elevated sCDD
               thresholds were also observed in iAMD eyes with normal DA.
               Elevated sCDD thresholds were associated with increased age and

              reliability and reproducibility of an automated rEZR
              quantification method. Methods: The rEZR was acquired using a
              manual and an automated approach in eyes with age-related macular
              degeneration (AMD) and healthy controls. The rEZR obtained from
              both methods was compared and the agreement between the methods

              participants with a mean ($\pm$ standard deviation) age of 65.2
              $\pm$ 7.8 years were included. Both the manual and automated
              method showed that control eyes exhibit a greater rEZR than AMD
              eyes (P < 0.001). Overall, the limits of agreement between the
              manual and automated method were -7.5 to 7.3 arbitrary units (AU)
              and 95\% of the data points had a difference in the rEZR between
              the methods of $\pm$8.2\%. An expected perfect reproducibility
              was observed for the automated method, whereas the manual method
              had a coefficient of repeatability of 6.3 arbitrary units.

              with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods: Six-year
              longitudinal multimodal retinal imaging data (MODIAMD study) from
              98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD in the study eye
              at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at
              each annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and
              further progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and
              outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging data were
              compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography
              only. Results: Seventeen study eyes with development of central
              cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4\%) were identified
              based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60\%) of these eyes, presence
              of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color
              fundus photography. In six (35\%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by
              the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward the fovea.
              Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In
              two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile
              deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large
              drusen or refractile deposits were detectable before atrophy
              occurrence in one eye. Conclusions: The earlier and more precise
              detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to
              atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows
              for more accurate detection and identification of different
              pathways for atrophy development. In accordance with previous

              (BCVA) in eyes with foveal-sparing geographic atrophy (GA)
              secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods:
              Best corrected visual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic
              Retinopathy Study charts); serial fundus autofluorescence; and
              near-infrared reflectance images of patients participating in the
              FAM (NCT00393692) and DSGA (NCT02051998) studies were analyzed.
              The sizes of GA and spared fovea, and the minimal linear
              dimension of intact retinal pigment epithelium (``bridge'')
              between the residual foveal island and the surrounding retina
              were quantified and associations with BCVA were assessed by local
              regression curves and mixed effects models. Results: A total of
              65 eyes (51 patients, aged 75.68 $\pm$ 8.41 years) were included.
              Median time between baseline and last visit with detectable
              foveal sparing was 18 (quartiles: 12, 33) months. Median BCVA was
              0.30 (0.20, 0.52) logMAR at baseline and 0.4 (0.3, 0.7) logMAR at
              follow-up. Local regression curves suggested no linear
              association of BCVA with GA size, sparing size or bridge size.
              Most contrasting values for BCVA were observed for >1.5 mm2
              foveal-sparing size and for 400 $\mu$m bridge size. Employing
              these values as cutoff levels, mixed effects modeling revealed
              that both anatomic parameters, but not time, significantly
              impacted BCVA. Conclusions: During the review period eyes with
              foveal-sparing GA were likely to maintain the baseline BCVA.
              There was no linear correlation of BCVA with foveal-sparing size.
              Yet, BCVA was worse if the spared foveal area was <1.5 mm2 or if
              the bridge was smaller than 400 $\mu$m in width. These findings
              add to the understanding of the natural history of foveal-sparing
              GA and may support future clinical trial designs.",

               qualitative and quantitative optical coherence tomography

               presence of small-caliber vessels, peripheral arcades, and a
               ­perilesional OCTA signal attenuation as well as values for
               vessel length, density, and branching index were evaluated for
               each CNV network in a 6 $\times$ 6 mm OCTA scan pattern.
               Results: Fifty-one eyes of 51 patients with AMD (age 75.9 $\pm$
               7.5 years; 20 males [39.2\%]) were included. The qCNV subgroup
               (n = 8) showed the highest prevalence of qualitative and
               quantitative values for OCTA activity criteria, reaching
               significance with regard to small-caliber vessels (p = 0.003),
               peripheral arcades (p = 0.039), vessel length (p = 0.020), and

               associated with the number of previous anti-VEGF injections
               (each p < 0.03), while quantitative metrics also suggested lower
               values. Conclusions: These findings suggest that OCTA may be
               supportive in the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions

               and retinal atrophy in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum
               (PXE). Methods: This retrospective study included patient data
               from a dedicated PXE clinic at the Department of Ophthalmology,
               University of Bonn, Germany (observation period from February
               2008 to July 2023). Two readers evaluated the presence,
               localization, and the extent of the ODD on fundus
               autofluorescence (FAF) imaging at baseline and the follow-up
               assessments. Additionally, we measured the length of the longest
               AS visible at baseline and follow-up and the area of atrophy at
               baseline, both on FAF. Results: A total of 150 eyes of 75 PXE
               patients (median age at baseline 51.8 years, IRQ 46.3; 57.5
               years, 49 female) underwent retrospective analysis. At baseline,
               23 of 75 patients exhibited ODD in a minimum of one eye,
               resulting in an ODD prevalence of 30.7\% in our cohort of PXE
               patients. Among these, 14 patients showed monocular and 9
               binocular ODD that were localized predominantly nasally
               (46.9\%). During the observational period (mean 97.5 $\pm$ 44.7
               months), only one patient developed de novo ODD in one eye and
               one other patient showed a progression in the size of the
               existing ODD. The group of patients with ODD had significantly
               longer ASs (median 7020 µm, IQR 4604; 9183, vs. AS length
               without ODD: median 4404 µm, IQR 3512; 5965, p < 0.001). No
               association with the size of the atrophy was found at baseline
               (p = 0.27). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a prevalence of
               ODD of 30.7\%. ODD presence is associated with longer ASs (an
               indicator of the severity and extent of ocular Bruch's membrane
               calcification), suggesting that ODD formation is tightly related
               to ectopic calcification-possibly secondary to calcification of
               the lamina cribrosa. Prospective studies investigating the
               impact of ODD (in conjunction with intraocular pressure) on

               macular degeneration (iAMD) within the cross-sectional part of
               the observational multicenter MACUSTAR study. Methods: Certified
               site personnel obtained multimodal imaging data at two visits
               (38 $\pm$ 20 [mean $\pm$ standard deviation] days apart),
               including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
               One junior reader performed systematic and blinded grading at
               the central reading center, followed by senior reader review.
               Structural biomarkers included maximum drusen size
               classification (>63 to $\leq$125 µm vs. >125 µm), presence of
               large pigment epithelium detachments (PEDs), reticular
               pseudodrusen (RPD), vitelliform lesions, and refractile
               deposits. Intrasession variability was assessed using Cohen's
               $\kappa$ statistics. Results: At the first visit, 202 study eyes
               of 202 participants were graded as manifesting with either early
               (n = 34) or intermediate (n = 168) AMD. Grading of imaging data
               between visits revealed perfect agreement for the maximum drusen
               size classification ($\kappa$ = 0.817; 95\% confidence interval,
               0.70-0.94). In iAMD eyes, perfect to substantial agreement was
               determined for the presence of large PEDs (0.87; 0.69-1.00) and
               RPD (0.752; 0.63-0.87), while intersession agreement was lower
               for the presence of vitelliform lesions (0.649; 0.39-0.65) and
               refractile deposits (0.342; -0.029-0.713), respectively.
               Conclusions: Multimodal retinal imaging analysis between
               sessions showed a higher repeatability for structural biomarkers
               with predefined cutoff values than purely qualitative defined
               parameters. Translational Relevance: A high repeatability of
               retinal imaging biomarkers will be important to implement
               automatic grading approaches and to establish robust and

               healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography
               (OCT angiography). METHODS: OCT angiography was performed via an
               Avanti\textregistered{} RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc.,
               Fremont, CA, USA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and
               healthy adults. A frame centered on the fovea was used for FAZ
               measurements. The borders of the superficial vascular layer were
               defined as 3 $\mu$m below the internal limiting membrane (ILM)
               and 15 $\mu$m below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the
               deep vascular layer as15 $\mu$m and 70 $\mu$m below the IPL,
               respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured in
               all eyes by two graders. RESULTS: In healthy eyes (N = 25), the
               FAZ surrounding vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical
               or horizontal oval symmetrical formation with a maximum diameter
               usually on the horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic eyes (N =
               29) presented with disintegrity of the vascular arcades,
               resulting in an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer, the mean
               horizontal FAZ diameter was significantly larger in the DR group
               (753 $\mu$m $\pm$272 $\mu$m) than in the control group (573
               $\mu$m $\pm$177 $\mu$m, p = 0.029). The difference was even more
               pronounced in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 $\mu$m
               $\pm$194 $\mu$m in the control group and 1009 $\mu$m $\pm$342
               $\mu$m in the DR group (p = 0.001). Furthermore, in the
               superficial layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was 0°
               ($\pm$15°) or 90° ($\pm$15°) in 72.0 \% of healthy eyes. In eyes
               with DR, the angle was 0° ($\pm$15°) or 90° ($\pm$15°) in only
               6.9 \% of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ.
               CONCLUSIONS: OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal
               vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can
               detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ,

               abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.",

               global RNFL thickness was identified in RPGR-associated RP,
               which was, however, less pronounced in progressed disease as

               retinal characteristics in patients with RPGR-associated RP
               including a pronounced peripapillary RNFL thickness compared to
               healthy controls. These results contribute to the knowledge
               about imaging biomarkers in RP, which might be of interest for

              in mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour fundus-controlled
              perimetry (FCP) in macular diseases. METHODS: Seventy-seven eyes
              (30 eyes with macular diseases and 47 normal eyes) underwent
              duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour FCP (Scotopic
              Macular Integrity Assessment, CenterVue). Non-weighted (mean
              defect, loss variance), variability-weighted (mean deviation,
              pattern standard deviation (PSD)) and graphical (cumulative
              defect (Bebie) curves) indices were computed. Reproducibility
              (coefficient of repeatability, CoR) of these indices was
              assessed. Cluster analysis was carried out to identify patterns
              of visual field deficits. RESULTS: The intrasession
              reproducibility was lower for the mean defect as compared with
              the mean deviation (CoR (dB) 2.67 vs 2.57 for mesopic, 1.71 vs
              1.45 for dark-adapted cyan, 1.94 vs 1.87 for dark-adapted red
              testing) and lower for the square-root loss variance as compared
              with the PSD (CoR (dB) 1.48 vs 1.34, 0.77 vs 0.65, 1.23 vs 1.03).
              Hierarchical cluster analysis of the indices disclosed six
              patterns of visual field deficits (approximately unbiased P
              value>0.95) with varying degrees of global versus focal defect
              and rod versus cone dysfunction. These were also reflected by the
              cumulative defect curves. CONCLUSION: FCP with mesopic and
              dark-adapted two-colour testing allows for reproducible
              assessment of different types of retinal sensitivity, whereby
              mean deviation and PSD exhibited the better retest reliability of
              the tested indices. Distinct patterns of retinal dysfunction can
              be identified using this setup, reflecting variable degrees of
              rod and cone dysfunction in different macular diseases.

               threat to vision loss in individuals older than 50 years. While
               neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is
               currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD.
               Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows
               considerable interindividual variability, but little is known
               about prognostic factors. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the
               contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy
               lesion growth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled
               analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus
               Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration
               (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA)
               study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the
               Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each
               provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific
               designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were
               recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the
               database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at
               the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). MAIN
               OUTCOMES: The correlation between square root-transformed
               geographic atrophy growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants
               passing quality control was estimated using linear regression.
               The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing
               geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral
               geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and
               follow-up times. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Slopes per allele,
               95\% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with
               geographic atrophy lesion growth. RESULTS: A total of 935
               patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female
               participants [59.0\%]) were included. Two gene loci with
               conservative genome-wide significance were identified. Each
               minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased
               the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15\% or
               0.05 mm per year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests
               the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome
               1; slope, 0.046 [95\% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 $\times$ 10-8)
               and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope,
               0.105 [95\% CI, 0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 $\times$ 10-7) as the
               most likely progression-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS AND
               RELEVANCE: These data provide further insight into the genetic
               architecture of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic
               atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for
               effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising
               candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional
               aspects of geographic atrophy progression and also for designing
               novel and targeted treatment options.",

              Methods: Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to AMD
              were recruited in the context of the Longitudinal Fundus
              Autofluorescence in Age-related Macular Degeneration and
              Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy studies (NCT00393692,
              NCT02051998). Horizontal and vertical SD-OCT scans were acquired
              at sequential visits using a device allowing for anatomically
              accurate registration of follow-up to baseline scans. For
              quantification of local atrophy progression, the lateral spread
              of GA (LSGA) was measured. Further, border types were
              independently graded. Comparison of LSGA between the different
              border types was performed using linear mixed-effects models.
              Results: Seventy-two eyes of 49 patients (27 female) aged 74.0
              years (Inter quartile range [IQR], 68.1-79.0) were included into
              this analysis. A total of 258 border sections were analyzed
              longitudinally over a median period of 1.2 years (IQR, 0.9-1.6).
              At baseline, 17.1\% borders were classified as 'regular', 47.7\%
              as 'irregular', and 35.3\% as 'splitting'. Sixty-two percent of
              the eyes exhibited more than one border type. LSGA was slowest in
              'regular' borders (62.85 $\pm$ 25.29 $\mu$m/y), followed by
              'irregular' borders (91.15 $\pm$ 15.05 $\mu$m/y) and fastest in
              'splitting' borders (183.15 $\pm$ 18.17 $\mu$m/y). Differences
              between the 'splitting' and each other border type were
              statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The results
              indicate that SD-OCT-based assessment of local GA border
              morphology can serve as a predictor for local atrophy

              fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in age-related macular
              degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Eleven eyes from 11 patients
              underwent mesopic and, after 30 minutes of dark adaptation,
              scotopic (MP-1S: Goldmann V, 200 ms, background luminance 0.0032
              cd/m2; S-MAIA: Goldman III, 200 ms, background luminance <0.0001

              scotopic FCP were performed. For both devices, a grid of 56
              stimulus points covering 16° of the central macula was used.
              Examination time, fixation stability, and threshold values were
              analyzed. RESULTS: The upper end of the dynamic range ($\leq$4 dB
              of lowest threshold) was frequently reached by the MP-1S for
              mesopic testing (median 34 of 56 stimuli), while threshold values
              within the lower 4 dB of the dynamic range were occasionally
              found with the S-MAIA for scotopic testing (median 3 for cyan,
              median 2 for red). After correction of the stimulus intensity for
              the S-MAIA results, the median difference for all stimuli between
              both devices for mesopic testing was -2.0 dB (interquartile range
              [-4;0], range -14 to 6). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that
              robust testing of mesopic and scotopic function is feasible with
              both devices in patients with AMD, although both devices are
              susceptible to floor and ceiling effects. TRANSLATIONAL
              RELEVANCE: The interpretation and particularly the comparison of
              both scotopic and mesopic FCP results between the MP-1S and the
              S-MAIA in AMD eyes need to consider variable susceptibility of
              floor and ceiling effects. Further software updates are desirable

              Macular Degeneration Study were phenotyped for diffuse-trickling
              GA (dt-GA; n = 44). DNA was analyzed for 10 known AMD-associated

              genetic risk profile from other GA phenotypes secondary to AMD.
              Disease-associated C1QTNF5 mutations were not identified.
              Together, these results suggest that the dt-GA phenotype is

               mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505

              excitation = 488 nm) and near-infrared reflectance (NIR; 820 nm)
              -based grading. Methods: Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
              (cSLO) GAF, BAF, and NIR images of 40 eyes from 29 patients (mean
              age 79.7 years) with GA secondary to AMD were recorded according
              to a standardized protocol. GA areas were analyzed in GAF, BAF
              combined with NIR (BAF+NIR), or BAF alone, by four independent
              readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder; Heidelberg
              Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). A mixed-effects model was used
              to assess the effect of image modality on the measured
              square-root lesion area. The coefficient of repeatability (CR)
              and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were assessed for
              the square-root lesion area, lesion perimeter, and circularity.
              Results: GAF-based measurements were on average 0.062 mm (95\%
              confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than BAF+NIR-based
              measurements and 0.077 mm (95\% CI 0.06 - 0.10 mm) larger than
              BAF-based measurements. Interreader agreement was highest for
              GAF-based analysis ([CR, ICC] 0.196 mm, 0.995) followed by
              BAF+NIR (0.232 mm, 0.992) and BAF alone (0.263 mm, 0.991). The
              same was noted for the lesion perimeter and circularity. Post hoc
              review revealed that interreader differences were associated with
              media opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation
              to a larger extent in BAF than in GAF. Conclusions: cSLO-based
              GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging with semiautomated lesion
              delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible quantification
              of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF
              suggests that its use may be preferable in clinical trials
              examining the change in lesion size as a clinical endpoint.",

               patients 130; mean age: 72.2 $\pm$ 13.08 years) with a median
               follow-up of 2.38 years from 2 prospective, noninterventional

               determine the lesion area, circularity, perimeter, and caliper
               diameters. These variables and the fundus autofluorescence
               phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future square
               root progression rates using linear mixed-effects models.
               RESULTS: For the combined model, leave-one-out cross validation
               on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown patient)
               resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and
               leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2:
               previous observation of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This
               indicated that shape-descriptive factors could explain 24.4\% of
               the variance in geographic atrophy progression in previously
               unknown patients and 39.1\% in patients with previous
               observation. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the relevance of
               shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic
               variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a
               substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic
               atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables, some of
               which are visible in optical coherence tomography.",

               prognostic value for conversion into advanced AMD stages.
               DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal natural history study.
               PARTICIPANTS: Ninety-one eyes of 91 patients with AMD
               (73.3$\pm$7.3 years; 62 female patients [50.4\%]) of the
               Molecular Diagnostic of Age-related Macular Degeneration
               (MODIAMD) study without exudative or nonexudative late-stage AMD
               in the study eye at baseline. METHODS: At each annual follow-up
               visit, all subjects underwent ophthalmic examination with
               assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal
               imaging, including spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), over a study

               changes of retinal layers in comparison with established risk
               factors in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with
               regard to their prognostic value for conversion into advanced
               AMD stages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative structural AMD
               features and SD-OCT-based quantitative thickness changes of
               different retinal layers, such as the retinal pigment
               epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC), were assessed by multimodal
               imaging. Their prognostic relevance regarding disease conversion
               was determined using Cox regression (cloglog link function).
               RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the presence of focal
               hyperpigmentation, almost reaching statistical significance,
               showed the strongest effect regarding the development of
               nonexudative late-stage AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 5.88; 95\%
               confidence interval [CI], 0.69-50.2; P = 0.052) followed by the
               presence of refractile drusen (HR, 4.82; 95\% CI, 1.33-17.44; P
               = 0.0164). A thickening of the RPEDC was the only assessed
               retinal layer that exhibited a significant effect on the
               development of nonexudative advanced AMD (HR, 1.03; 95\% CI,
               1.0-1.07; P = 0.0393), whereas no association was observable for
               the other retinal layers. Neither qualitative nor quantitative
               markers were significant predictors for the development of
               exudative late-stage AMD (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results
               indicate that the development of both exudative and nonexudative
               AMD is associated with distinct prognostic features. However,
               compared with the assessment of qualitative AMD features, the
               quantification of retinal layers on average across the central
               retina had less prognostic impact. Further studies are needed to
               identify and validate robust biomarkers in early AMD stages.",

               METHODS: In this prospective case-control study, dark adaptation
               thresholds were measured using a Goldmann-Weekers dark
               adaptometer. Additional assessments included best-corrected
               visual acuity testing, contrast sensitivity, low luminance

               significantly worse in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum
               (all, P < 0.001). Two patients were treated with high-dose
               vitamin A which partially reversed impaired dark adaptation.
               CONCLUSION: Patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum often have
               impaired dark adaptation. Positive effects of vitamin A
               supplementation may indicate restricted retinal access of

              (OCT-A) in normal individuals and patients with diabetic
              retinopathy (DR). METHODS: Images (a 3 $\times$ 3 mm cube
              centered on the fovea) were acquired in 40 eyes of 22 normal
              individuals and 28 eyes of 18 patients with varying levels of DR
              using a swept-source OCT-A device (central wavelength 1050 nm;
              A-scan-rate of 100,000 scans per second). En face images of the
              retinal vasculature were generated from the superficial and deep
              retinal layers (SRL/DRL). Quantitative analysis of the vessel
              density (VD) and FAZ area was performed. Vessel density was
              assessed as the ratio of the retinal area occupied by vessels.
              RESULTS: Among the DR subjects (mean age, 72 years; 61\% male),
              35.7\% of the eyes had mild, 35.7\% moderate, and 7.1\% severe
              nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 21.4\% and proliferative DR
              (PDR). The mean FAZ area in patients with DR and in normal
              individuals was 0.518 and 0.339 mm2, respectively, for the SRL (P
              = 0.003), and 0.615 and 0.358 mm2, respectively, for the DRL (P <

              significantly lower in patients with DR (SRL, P < 0.001; DRL, P =
              0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Swept-source OCT-A of the microcirculation
              in eyes of patients with DR can be used to quantitatively
              demonstrate alterations in the FAZ and VD in the SRL/DRL of the

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: To assess the onset, treatment frequency, and visual
               outcome of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
               treatment due to secondary choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in
               patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). DESIGN:
               Retrospective cohort study METHODS: One-hundred six eyes of 53
               patients with PXE were analyzed. The assessment of CNV activity
               relied on hemorrhage visible on funduscopy and intra- /
               subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT),
               individually defining a shortening or extension of treatment
               interval. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, age
               at anti-VEGF therapy initiation, and BCVA-drop events at
               exudation onset (worsening of BCVA of 2 or more lines) were
               documented. Further, we assessed the number of injections during
               the first year and the total number of injections, the time to
               treatment initiation of the fellow eye, and BCVA over time.
               RESULTS: During a median observation period of 77 months (IQR
               49; 126) patients received a median number of 28.0
               anti-VEGF-injections (IQR 9.8; 43.5). Eight patients received no
               injection (median age at baseline 38.1 years), 11 patients
               underwent anti-VEGF treatment in one eye (median age 47.2 years)
               and 34 patients in both eyes (median age 51.8 years). The median
               age at the first anti-VEGF treatment was 52.80 years (IQR
               47.2-57.6). Applying Cox regression models, the median
               ``survival'' time of fellow eye until treatment initiation was
               16.8 months. In the group of bilateral treated patients, the
               median time difference was 9.6 months (IQR 2.1- 32.4, range
               0-122) The median number of injections was 5.5 per eye in the
               first year of treatment (IQR 3-7) and was associated with the
               total number of injections in the observation period (2.33, CI
               1.22-3.44, P < .001). A better BCVA at the last follow-up visit
               was associated with a better baseline BCVA (P < .001, R2 =
               0.318) and with the absence of a BCVA drop at the onset of
               exudation (P = 0.035, R2 = 0.339). CONCLUSIONS: The results of
               this study indicate that anti-VEGF treatment is required for
               most PXE patients at a relatively young age. Once treatment in
               one eye is initiated, the time to fellow eye treatment is
               relatively short. A BCVA drop before treatment initiation is a
               risk factor for worse visual outcomes, suggesting that treatment
               is prudent before exudation affects the central retina. Given
               the young age of onset and intensive treatment needs, patients
               with PXE might particularly benefit from longer-acting anti-VEGF
               therapeutics.",

               between Munc18-1 and closed syntaxin 1 is well described, the
               mechanism of how Munc18-1 stimulates membrane fusion remains
               elusive. Using a reconstituted assay that resolves vesicle
               docking, priming, clamping, and fusion during synaptic
               exocytosis, we show that helix 12 in domain 3a of Munc18-1
               stimulates SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. A single point
               mutation (L348R) within helix 12 selectively abolishes VAMP2
               binding and the stimulatory function of Munc18-1 in membrane
               fusion. In contrast, targeting a natural switch site (P335A) at
               the start of helix 12, which can result in an extended
               $\alpha$-helical conformation, further accelerates lipid-mixing.
               Together with structural modeling, the data suggest that helix
               12 provides a folding template for VAMP2, accelerating SNAREpin
               assembly and membrane fusion. Analogous SEC1/Munc18-SNARE
               interactions at other transport steps may provide a general
               mechanism to drive lipid bilayer merger. At the neuronal

               epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA and cRORA,
               respectively) in patients with intermediate age-related macular
               degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: OCT images from patients enrolled
               in Proxima B clinical trial (NCT02399072) were utilized.
               PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in the Proxima B clinical trial,
               from the cohort with geographic atrophy (GA) in 1 eye and iAMD
               in the other eye at baseline, were included. METHODS: Junior and
               senior readers analyzed OCT images for the qualitative presence
               of 9 distinct early atrophic features (presence of zone of
               choroidal hypertransmission, attenuation and/or disruption of
               RPE, disruption of ellipsoid zone [EZ] and external limiting
               membrane [ELM], outer nuclear layer [ONL] thinning, outer
               plexiform layer [OPL]/inner nuclear layer [INL] subsidence, and
               hyporeflective wedge-shaped band). If deemed ``present,'' 7
               features were quantified with a predefined tolerance level of 50
               $\mu$m (diameter for the zone of choroidal hypertransmission,
               zone of attenuation and/or disruption of the RPE, outer retinal
               thickness left/right vertical diameter, outer retinal thickness
               thinnest vertical diameter, annotation of EZ, and ELM
               disruption). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interreader agreements for
               qualitative assessments ($\kappa$-type statistics) and
               quantitative measurements (Bland-Altman statistics) were
               assessed. Progression of the lesion features over time was
               described. RESULTS: Moderate agreement was found for presence of
               choroidal hypertransmission ($\kappa$ = 0.54), followed by ELM
               disruption ($\kappa$ = 0.58), OPL/INL subsidence ($\kappa$ =
               0.46), and a hyporeflective wedge-shaped band ($\kappa$ = 0.47).
               Quantification measurements showed that choroidal
               hypertransmission had the highest agreement, whereas RPE
               attenuation/disruption had the lowest agreement. Longitudinal
               adjudicated changes for quantitative measurements of lesion
               progression showed that choroidal hypertransmission and ELM
               disruption showed significant progression, whereas EZ disruption
               and RPE attenuation/disruption did not. CONCLUSIONS: The ability
               to evaluate changes over time for specific features of iRORA and
               cRORA was explored. The most robust biomarker was found to be
               choroidal hypertransmission, followed by ELM disruption and the
               qualitative markers of OPL/INL subsidence, as well as a
               wedge-shaped band. Disease progression over time could be
               assessed by some, but not all, spectral-domain OCT features that
               were explored. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or

              compared with the area obtained by en face segmentation. RESULTS:
              The mean $\pm$ SD for the HE area was 1.78 $\pm$ 1.37 mm with
              B-scan segmentation and 0.72 $\pm$ 0.82 mm with the automated en

               Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF

               forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting

               mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual
               anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure.
               Results: In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular
               AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of
               future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an
               accuracy (MAE [95\% confidence interval]) of 2.60
               injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest

               using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well
               calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based
               predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the
               central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across

               enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment
               frequency in real-world settings. Translational Relevance:
               Prediction of a probability distribution allows the physician to

               case-series was initiated to evaluate initial clinical
               experience with the first commercially available intraoperative
               optical coherence tomography system (iOCT). PATIENTS AND
               METHODS: The Rescan 700 iOCT (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), a
               spectral-domain OCT system integrated into a surgical
               microscope, was used in 40 consecutive cases. A standardized
               review was used to assess whether iOCT imaging resulted in
               additional information and/or altered decision-making. RESULTS:
               The iOCT system was usable in conjunction with common
               chromovitrectomy dyes and tamponades. The surgeons reported that
               iOCT imaging provided additional information in 74.1\% of the
               posterior and combined surgical cases, which resulted in altered
               decision-making in 41.9\% of the cases. The iOCT imaging time,
               on average, amounted to 167 seconds. In anterior procedures, the
               surgeons reported gaining additional information in 22.2\% of
               all cases, but no cases of altered decision-making were
               reported. Hereby, the iOCT imaging time amounted to 117 seconds,
               on average. CONCLUSION: The demonstrated results suggest iOCT
               has the potential to improve the quality of posterior and

  author    = "Pfau, Maximilian and Fassnacht-Riederle, Heidi and Becker,

  abstract  = "PURPOSE: After 48 months, unresolved macular edema secondary to
               central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is present in more than
               half of the patients treated with ranibizumab/bevacizumab.
               Switching therapy to aflibercept, a more recent vascular
               endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, as well as
               VEGF-B and placental growth factor inhibitor, might improve the
               clinical outcome in patients with CRVO who respond
               insufficiently to ranibizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: The
               presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n
               = 13) responding insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or
               bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6 weeks or more
               frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to
               aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and
               extend' regime. The injection interval, relapse-free interval,
               central retinal thickness, central retinal volume, visual
               acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated prior to
               switching to aflibercept and at month 6 and year 1 after
               switching therapy. RESULTS: From baseline to year 1 after
               switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval
               (primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the
               relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003). The mean
               central retinal thickness decreased by 195.84 µm and the mean
               central retinal volume (6 mm diameter) by -1.81 mm3 (p = 0.007).
               Correspondingly, the mean ETDRS score increased from 66.15 at
               baseline to 76.54 letters at year 1 after switching therapy to
               aflibercept (+10.38 letters, p = 0.021). The IOP was not
               statistically significantly affected (-1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.196).
               CONCLUSION: Switching therapy from intravitreal
               ranibizumab/bevacizumab to aflibercept in insufficiently
               responding macular edema secondary to CRVO elongates the
               injection interval and the relapse-free interval and provides an
               improved anatomical as well as functional outcome.",

               atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy were examined
               longitudinally with fundus autofluorescence imaging. Lesion
               area, perimeter, circularity, caliper diameters, and focality of
               areas with definitely decreased autofluorescence were
               determined. A model was used to predict the lesion enlargement
               rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were
               performed to model the power in a simulated interventional
               study. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range,
               14-78 years) with a follow-up time of 10 to 100 months were
               included. The mean annual progression of retinal pigment
               epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic areas,
               the retina-wide functional impairment, and the age-of-onset
               category constituted significant predictors for future retinal
               pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining 25.7\% of the
               variability. By extension of a simulated study length and/or
               specific patient preselection based on these baseline
               characteristics, the required sample size could significantly be
               reduced. CONCLUSION: Trial design based on specific
               shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics
               and the adaption of the trial duration may provide potential
               benefits in required cohort size and absolute number of visits.",
