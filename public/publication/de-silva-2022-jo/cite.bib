 abstract = {Purpose: This study investigates deep-learning (DL) sequence
modeling techniques to reliably fit dark adaptation (DA) curves
and estimate their key parameters in patients with age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) to improve robustness and curve
predictions. Methods: A long-short-term memory autoencoder was
used as the DL method to model the DA curve. The performance was
compared against the classical nonlinear regression method using
goodness-of-fit and repeatability metrics. Experiments were
performed to predict the latter portion of the curve using data
from early measurements. The prediction accuracy was quantified
as the rod intercept time (RIT) prediction error between
predicted and actual curves. Results: The two models had
comparable goodness-of-fit measures, with root mean squared
error (RMSE; SD) = 0.11 (0.04) log-units (LU) for the classical
model and RMSE = 0.13 (0.06) LU for the DL model. Repeatability
of the curve fits evaluated after introduction of random
perturbations, and after performing repeated testing,
demonstrated superiority of the DL method, especially among
parameters related to cone decay. The DL method exhibited
superior ability to predict the curve and RIT using points prior
to -2 LU, with 3.1 $±$ 3.1 minutes RIT prediction error,
compared to 19.1 $±$ 18.6 minutes RIT error for the classical
method. Conclusions: The parameters obtained from the DL method
demonstrated superior robustness as well as predictability of
the curve. These could provide important advances in using
multiple DA curve parameters to characterize AMD severity.
Translational Relevance: Dark adaptation is an important
functional measure in studies of AMD and curve modeling using DL
methods can lead to improved clinical trial end points.},
