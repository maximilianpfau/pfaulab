 abstract = {To determine the effective dynamic range (EDR), retest reliability, and number of discriminable steps (DS) for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) using the S-MAIA (Scotopic-Macular Integrity Assessment) "micro-perimeter."\\ of the central retina. The EDR, the number of DS, and the retest reliability for point-wise sensitivity (PWS) were analyzed. The effects of fixation stability, sensitivity, and age on retest reliability were examined using mixed-effects models.\\ 4.77 dB, respectively) and did not depend on fixation stability or age. PWS had no effect on retest variability in dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red testing but had a minor effect in mesopic testing.\\ Combined mesopic and dark-adapted two-color FCP allows for reliable topographic testing of cone and rod function in patients with various macular diseases with and without foveal fixation. Retest reliability is homogeneous across eccentricities and various degrees of scotoma depth, including zones at risk for disease progression. These reliability estimates can serve for the design of future clinical trials.},
