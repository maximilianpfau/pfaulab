We evaluated the qualitative and quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) features of these CNV subgroups.\\ 6 mm OCTA scan pattern.\\ 0.03), while quantitative metrics also suggested lower values.\\ These findings suggest that OCTA may be supportive in the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions secondary to AMD, while the assessed structural changes appeared to be more indicative of previously administered anti-VEGF therapy than current exudative activity.},
