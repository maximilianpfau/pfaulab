 abstract = {To investigate retinal sensitivity in the junctional zone of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration using patient-tailored perimetry grids for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry.\\ . The grids were used for duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-color (cyan and red) fundus-controlled perimetry. Age-adjusted reference-data were obtained through regression analysis of normative data followed by spatial interpolation.\\ 0.01).\\ m) was observed that leveled off at more distant test-points. In proximity to the GA boundary, the results indicate that rod exceeded cone dysfunction.},
