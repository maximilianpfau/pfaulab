 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the spatial distribution of reticular
pseudodrusen (RPD) in eyes with age-related macular degeneration
(AMD) and their correlation with functional measures, retinal
thickness, and changes over time. DESIGN: Longitudinal, cohort
study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five participants with RPD and
spectrum of AMD severity (including no AMD). METHODS: Multimodal
imaging was graded by a reading center, including evaluation of
color fundus imaging to assess AMD severity scores. Reticular
pseudodrusen presence on OCT volumes was confirmed on en face
imaging and the RPD extent was contoured on infrared images. One
study eye per participant underwent rod-mediated dark
adaptation, measuring rod intercept time (RIT) at 5° and, if
needed, 12° superior to the fovea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The
primary outcome was RIT and OCT thickness measures which were
correlated with RPD area. RESULTS: A total of 51 eyes had $≥$
1 visit with RPD detected (mean follow-up, 2.19 $±$ 2.04
years; range, 0-5 years), totaling 169 eye-based visits with
RPD. Of the 51 eyes with RPD, 5 (9.8%) developed geographic
atrophy and 17 (33.3%) progressed to neovascular AMD. Larger
RPD areas were detected more frequently in AMD severity scores
6-7. Reticular pseudodrusen area within an eye generally
increased over time. The lesion distribution showed a
predilection for the superior retina, especially the outer
superior subfield of the ETDRS grid, with the central subfield
having least involvement. Reticular pseudodrusen area was
inversely correlated with central subfield thickness and
positively correlated with RIT at 5° (P = 0.001; r2 = 0.01) and
12° (P = 0.004; r2 = 0.01). Rod-mediated dark adaptation at 5°
reached the test ceiling in > 85% of visits, irrespective of
RPD lesion presence/absence at the test location. Retinal
thickness decreased monotonically, with the central subfield
demonstrating the greatest percentage change over 5 years
($Δ$ = -5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: In AMD, RPD involve
predominantly the superior retina but can involve all ETDRS
subfields and evolve over time. Eyes with RPD exhibit structural
and functional impairments that can be measured beyond the
boundaries of the RPD lesions, suggesting changes associated
with RPD are associated with both local changes and a more
widespread process. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES: Proprietary or
