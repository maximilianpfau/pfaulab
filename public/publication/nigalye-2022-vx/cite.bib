 abstract = {Dark adaptation (DA) refers to the slow recovery of visual
sensitivity in darkness following exposure to intense or
prolonged illumination, which bleaches a significant amount of
the rhodopsin. This natural process also offers an opportunity
to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate
for presence of disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a
key indicator of retinal health, which can be altered in the
presence of certain diseases, such as age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of DA
measurement and its significance to furthering our understanding
of AMD has revealed essential findings underlying the
pathobiology of the disease. The process of dark adaptation
involves phototransduction taking place mainly between the
photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) layer. DA occurs over a large range of luminance and is
modulated by both cone and rod photoreceptors. In the photopic
ranges, rods are saturated and cone cells adapt to the high
luminance levels. However, under scotopic ranges, cones are
unable to respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate the
responses to lower levels of light as they can respond to even a
single photon. Since the cone visual cycle is also based on the
Muller cells, measuring the impairment in rod-based dark
adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases
such as AMD, which involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark
adaptation parameters are metrics derived from curve-fitting
dark adaptation sensitivities over time and can represent
specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod
break (CRB) and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly
sensitive to changes in the outer retina. There is some
structural and functional continuum between normal aging and the
AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod
intercept time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD
patients with increasing disease severity determined by
increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the presence of
subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain
morphological features in the peripheral retina. Specifications
of spatial testing location, repeatability of the testing, ease
and availability of the testing device in clinical settings, and
test duration in elderly population are also important. We
provide a detailed overview in light of all these factors.},
