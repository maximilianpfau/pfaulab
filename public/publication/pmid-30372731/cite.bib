 abstract = {To determine the intrasession test-retest reliability of mesopic and dark-adapted fundus-controlled perimetry in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD).\\ of the central retina. Main outcome measure was the intrasession test-retest reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS).\\ 0.01).\\ The modified MAIA device allows for reliable mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry in iAMD patients. We found that iAMD is associated with both reduced mesopic and dark-adapted retinal sensitivity.},
