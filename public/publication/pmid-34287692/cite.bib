 abstract = {To investigate multimodal retinal imaging characteristics including the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with RPGR-associated retinitis pigmentosa (RP).\\ years) with RPGR-associated RP who underwent retinal imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT), short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence (AF) imaging, and RNFL scans centered on the optic disc. RNFL thickness was manually segmented and compared to clinical and imaging parameters including the transfoveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) width, the horizontal diameter of the macular hyperautofluorescent ring. RNFL thickness was compared to 17 age- and sex-matched controls.\\ 0.0001) increased global RNFL thickness was identified in RPGR-associated RP, which was, however, less pronounced in progressed disease as indicated by the EZ width or the diameter of the central hyperautofluorescent ring.\\ the knowledge about imaging biomarkers in RP, which might be of interest for therapeutic approaches such as gene replacement therapies.},
