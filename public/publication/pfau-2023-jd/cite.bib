 abstract = {Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the most common inherited retina
degeneration. It is caused by biallelic ABCA4 variants, and no
treatment is available to date. STGD1 shows marked phenotypic
variability, especially regarding the age of onset. The
underlying genotype can partially explain this variability.
Notably, a subset of ABCA4 variants was previously associated
with an earlier disease onset than truncating ABCA4 variants,
pointing toward pathogenic mechanisms beyond the loss of gene
function in these patients. On the other end of the spectrum,
variants such as p.Gly1961Glu were associated with markedly
slower extrafoveal disease progression. Given that these drastic
differences in phenotype are based on genotype (resulting in
important prognostic implications for patients), this chapter
reviews previous approaches to genotype-phenotype correlation
analyses in STGD1.},
