 abstract = {Geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular
degeneration is among the most common causes of irreversible
vision loss in industrialized countries. Recently, two therapies
have been approved by the US FDA. However, given the nature of
their treatment effect, which primarily involves a relative
decrease in disease progression, discerning the individual
treatment response at the individual level may not be readily
apparent. Thus, clinical decision-making may have to rely on the
quantification of the slope of GA progression before and during
treatment. A panel of imaging modalities and artificial
intelligence (AI)-based algorithms are available for such
quantifications. This article aims to provide a comprehensive
overview of the fundamentals of GA imaging, the procedures for
diagnosis and classification using these images, and the
cutting-edge role of AI algorithms in automatically deriving
diagnostic and prognostic insights from imaging data.},
