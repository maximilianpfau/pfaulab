 abstract = {Background/Objectives: To assess the frequency, extent,
localization and potential progression of optic disc drusen
(ODD) and the correlation with the angioid streak (AS) length
and retinal atrophy in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum
(PXE). Methods: This retrospective study included patient data
from a dedicated PXE clinic at the Department of Ophthalmology,
University of Bonn, Germany (observation period from February
2008 to July 2023). Two readers evaluated the presence,
localization, and the extent of the ODD on fundus
autofluorescence (FAF) imaging at baseline and the follow-up
assessments. Additionally, we measured the length of the longest
AS visible at baseline and follow-up and the area of atrophy at
baseline, both on FAF. Results: A total of 150 eyes of 75 PXE
patients (median age at baseline 51.8 years, IRQ 46.3; 57.5
years, 49 female) underwent retrospective analysis. At baseline,
23 of 75 patients exhibited ODD in a minimum of one eye,
resulting in an ODD prevalence of 30.7% in our cohort of PXE
patients. Among these, 14 patients showed monocular and 9
binocular ODD that were localized predominantly nasally
(46.9%). During the observational period (mean 97.5 $±$ 44.7
months), only one patient developed de novo ODD in one eye and
one other patient showed a progression in the size of the
existing ODD. The group of patients with ODD had significantly
longer ASs (median 7020 µm, IQR 4604; 9183, vs. AS length
without ODD: median 4404 µm, IQR 3512; 5965, p < 0.001). No
association with the size of the atrophy was found at baseline
(p = 0.27). Conclusions: This study demonstrates a prevalence of
ODD of 30.7%. ODD presence is associated with longer ASs (an
indicator of the severity and extent of ocular Bruch's membrane
calcification), suggesting that ODD formation is tightly related
to ectopic calcification-possibly secondary to calcification of
the lamina cribrosa. Prospective studies investigating the
impact of ODD (in conjunction with intraocular pressure) on
visual function in PXE warrant consideration.},
