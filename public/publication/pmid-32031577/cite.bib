 abstract = {To investigate characteristics of the foveal pit and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with Alport syndrome (AS), a rare monogenetic disease due to mutations in genes encoding for collagen type IV.\\ were correlated.\\ 0.09 mm2; P = 0.007), in line with OCT findings of a staircase foveopathy.\\ The foveal phenotypic spectrum in AS ranges from foveal hypoplasia and absence of a FAZ to staircase foveopathy with an enlarged FAZ. Because the development of the FAZ and foveal pit are closely related, these findings suggest an important role for collagen type IV in foveal development and maturation.},
