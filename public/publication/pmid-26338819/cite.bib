 abstract = {To analyze foveal avascular zone (FAZ) dimensions and symmetry in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared to healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT angiography).\\ m below the IPL, respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured in all eyes by two graders.\\ % of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ.\\ OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ, thus differentiating DM from healthy eyes. Vascular abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.},
