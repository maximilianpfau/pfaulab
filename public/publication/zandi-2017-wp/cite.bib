 abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of
repeated injections of dexamethasone implants in patients with
persistent diabetic macular edema (DME) despite prior therapies.
METHODS: This retrospective interventional study involved 47
DME-afflicted eyes, which were administered $≥$2 intravitreal
injections of dexamethasone. Group 1 (34 eyes) received a
dexamethasone monotherapy, whereas group 2 (13 eyes) received a
combination therapy with intravitreal antivascular endothelial
growth factor as needed. The duration of dexamethasone effect
until retreatment and the change in best-corrected visual acuity
(BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) were defined as
outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 197 injections of
dexamethasone were administered in group 1 and 52 in group 2
during a mean follow-up of 23 $±$ 10 and 24 $±$ 13 months,
respectively. Mean time to reinjection was 4.6 $±$ 0.5 (group
1) and 5.3 $±$ 1.0 months (group 2; P = 0.17). Reinjection
intervals did not shorten over time for up to 10 dexamethasone
injections per eye in group 1 and BCVA improved from before 1
month after the first implantation, 7.0 letters (P = 0.04). In
group 2, there was no significant improvement in BCVA at any time
point. CRT decreased from 534 $±$ 208 and 529 $±$ 215 $μ$m
to 287 $±$ 115 and 371 $±$ 78 $μ$m at 3 months and
increased to 460 $±$ 186 $μ$m and 547 $±$ 175 $μ$m before
reinjection (groups1 and 2, respectively). The maximal CRT before
each implantation remained stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: In eyes
with chronic DME that respond incompletely to prior therapy or
require frequent reinjections, dexamethasone shows promising
long-term anatomic and functional improvement. The absence of a
treatment effect reduction over time argues against a relevant
rebound phenomenon.},
