 abstract = {-related retinopathy using green (GAF) and blue fundus autofluorescence (BAF) imaging.\\ -related retinopathy underwent GAF- (518 nm excitation light) and BAF- (488 nm excitation light) imaging using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and circularity.\\ GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF and QDAF showed high intermodality and interreader agreement concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly higher for GAF-based grading ([95% coefficients of repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However, DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with intermodality agreement.\\ Both GAF- and BAF-based quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable results with possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic excitation light.\\ The high interreader agreement qualifies the use of DDAF progression in GAF and BAF imaging as potential morphologic outcome measure for interventional clinical trials and disease monitoring.},
