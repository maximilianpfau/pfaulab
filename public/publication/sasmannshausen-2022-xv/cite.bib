 abstract = {Purpose: To analyze the intersession repeatability of structural
biomarkers in eyes with early and intermediate age-related
macular degeneration (iAMD) within the cross-sectional part of
the observational multicenter MACUSTAR study. Methods: Certified
site personnel obtained multimodal imaging data at two visits
(38 $±$ 20 [mean $±$ standard deviation] days apart),
including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT).
One junior reader performed systematic and blinded grading at
the central reading center, followed by senior reader review.
Structural biomarkers included maximum drusen size
classification (>63 to $łeq$125 µm vs. >125 µm), presence of
large pigment epithelium detachments (PEDs), reticular
pseudodrusen (RPD), vitelliform lesions, and refractile
deposits. Intrasession variability was assessed using Cohen's
$ąppa$ statistics. Results: At the first visit, 202 study eyes
of 202 participants were graded as manifesting with either early
(n = 34) or intermediate (n = 168) AMD. Grading of imaging data
between visits revealed perfect agreement for the maximum drusen
size classification ($\p̨pa$ = 0.817; 95% confidence interval,
0.70-0.94). In iAMD eyes, perfect to substantial agreement was
determined for the presence of large PEDs (0.87; 0.69-1.00) and
RPD (0.752; 0.63-0.87), while intersession agreement was lower
for the presence of vitelliform lesions (0.649; 0.39-0.65) and
refractile deposits (0.342; -0.029-0.713), respectively.
Conclusions: Multimodal retinal imaging analysis between
sessions showed a higher repeatability for structural biomarkers
with predefined cutoff values than purely qualitative defined
parameters. Translational Relevance: A high repeatability of
retinal imaging biomarkers will be important to implement
automatic grading approaches and to establish robust and
meaningful structural clinical endpoints for future
interventional clinical trials in patients with iAMD.},
