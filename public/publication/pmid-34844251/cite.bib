 abstract = {0.001). Conclusions Patients with early SFD exhibit pronounced abnormalities of choriocapillaris flow signal on OCTA, which are not limited to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen in OCT imaging. Thus, analysis of the choriocapillaris flow may enable clinical trials at earlier disease stages in SFD.},
