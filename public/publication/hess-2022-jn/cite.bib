 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate the suitability of 6 rod- or
cone-mediated dark adaptation (DA) parameters as outcome
measures for clinical trials in age-related macular degeneration
(AMD), including their retest reliability, association with age
and disease severity, and measurable longitudinal change over
time. DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study
(Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01352975). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 191
patients with AMD and older participants followed longitudinally
over 5 years. METHODS: Dark adaptation testing was performed
using the AdaptDx dark adaptometer with a maximum test time of
40 minutes. A 2-part exponential-linear curve was fitted to
obtain values for cone decay, cone plateau, time to rod-cone
break, rod intercept time (RIT), rod adaptation rate (S2), and
area under the curve. Intersession retest reliability was
assessed in tests performed within 2 weeks using the
Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship of DA parameters with
age, AMD severity, and reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) presence was
evaluated using linear mixed models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
Retest reliability, association with disease severity, and
longitudinal change of 6 DA parameters. RESULTS: A total of 1329
DA curves were analyzed. Rod intercept time was the parameter
that showed the greatest reliability (intraclass correlation
coefficient of 0.88) and greatest association with age, AMD
severity, and RPD (marginal R2 of 0.38), followed by the
rod-mediated parameters area under the curve and rod-cone break.
Cone plateau appeared constant at lower RIT values but increased
with progressive rod dysfunction (RIT > 22.8 minutes) with a
slope of 0.07 log units per 10 minutes RIT prolongation.
Therefore, it might provide additional information in the
advanced stages of AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related macular
degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with
large differences in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition,
substantial differences in some parameters occur with age, even
accounting for AMD severity and RPD status. This supports the
2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and perhaps
AMD pathophysiology itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the
highest retest reliability, closest correlation with AMD
severity and RPD, and largest longitudinal changes. This
underscores the suitability of RIT as an outcome measure in
clinical trials. The cone plateau increases only in advanced
stages of kinetic rod dysfunction, indicating rod dysfunction
preceding cone dysfunction and degeneration in the temporal
sequence of pathology in AMD.},
