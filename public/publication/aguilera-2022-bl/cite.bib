 abstract = {Choroideremia is an X-linked, blinding retinal degeneration with
progressive loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelial
(RPE) cells, and choriocapillaris. To study the extent to which
these layers are disrupted in affected males and female
carriers, we performed multimodal adaptive optics imaging to
better visualize the in vivo pathogenesis of choroideremia in
the living human eye. We demonstrate the presence of
subclinical, widespread enlarged RPE cells present in all
subjects imaged. In the fovea, the last area to be affected in
choroideremia, we found greater disruption to the RPE than to
either the photoreceptor or choriocapillaris layers. The
unexpected finding of patches of photoreceptors that were
fluorescently-labeled, but structurally and functionally normal,
suggests that the RPE blood barrier function may be altered in
choroideremia. Finally, we introduce a strategy for detecting
enlarged cells using conventional ophthalmic imaging
instrumentation. These findings establish that there is
subclinical polymegathism of RPE cells in choroideremia.},
