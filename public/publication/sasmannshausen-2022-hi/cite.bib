 abstract = {Quantification of the relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity
(rEZR) might be a structural surrogate parameter for an early
disease progression in the context of age-related macular
degeneration (AMD). Within the European multicenter,
cross-sectional MACUSTAR study, we have devised an automatic
approach to determine the mean rEZR [arbitrary units, AU] at two
independent visits in SD-OCT volume scans in study participants.
Linear mixed-effects models were applied to analyze the
association of AMD stage and AMD associated high-risk features
including presence of pigmentary abnormalities, reticular
pseudodrusen (RPD), volume of the
retinal-pigment-epithelial-drusenoid-complex (RPEDC) with the
rEZR. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were determined
for rEZR reliability analysis. Within the overall study cohort
(301 participants), we could observe decreased rEZR values
(coefficient estimate $±$ standard error) of - 8.05 $±$ 2.44
AU (p = 0.0011) in the intermediate and of - 22.35 $±$ 3.28 AU
(p < 0.0001) in the late AMD group. RPD presence was
significantly associated with the rEZR in iAMD eyes (- 6.49
$±$ 3.14 AU; p = 0.0403), while there was a good ICC of 0.846
(95% confidence interval: 0.809; 0.876) in the overall study
cohort. This study showed an association of rEZR with increasing
disease severity and the presence of iAMD high-risk features.
Further studies are necessary to evaluate the rEZR's value as a
novel biomarker for AMD and disease progression.},
