 abstract = {To analyze the intersession repeatability of structural biomarkers in eyes with early and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) within the cross-sectional part of the observational multicenter MACUSTAR study.\\ statistics.\\ = 0.817; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.94). In iAMD eyes, perfect to substantial agreement was determined for the presence of large PEDs (0.87; 0.69-1.00) and RPD (0.752; 0.63-0.87), while intersession agreement was lower for the presence of vitelliform lesions (0.649; 0.39-0.65) and refractile deposits (0.342; -0.029-0.713), respectively.\\ Multimodal retinal imaging analysis between sessions showed a higher repeatability for structural biomarkers with predefined cutoff values than purely qualitative defined parameters.\\ A high repeatability of retinal imaging biomarkers will be important to implement automatic grading approaches and to establish robust and meaningful structural clinical endpoints for future interventional clinical trials in patients with iAMD.},
