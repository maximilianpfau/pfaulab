 abstract = {To define, characterize, and classify hyperreflectivity on optical coherence tomography and report its prevalence in macular telangiectasia Type 2.\\ 24 months using optical coherence tomography imaging.\\ Three hundred and twenty-two eyes from 161 patients were analyzed in the cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177 (55%) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15%) eyes. Hyperreflectivity correlated significantly with parameters indicative of disease progression. In the longitudinal analysis, 206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of 35.6 months. 17/86 eyes (20%) showed a de novo development of hyperreflectivity. 8/29 eyes (28%) with preexistent intraretinal hyperreflectivity developed outer retinal hyperreflectivity. A high proportion of eyes with outer retinal hyperreflectivity (17/52 [33%]) developed neovascular membranes.\\ Hyperreflectivity represents a common finding in macular telangiectasia Type 2 but lacks a uniform definition. We propose a hyperreflectivity grading scale that may help to estimate disease progression and identify eyes at risk for developing neovascular membranes.},
