 abstract = {Preservation of photoreceptors beyond areas of retinal pigment
epithelium atrophy is a critical treatment goal in eyes with
geographic atrophy (GA) to prevent vision loss. Thus, we
assessed the association of treatment with the complement C3
inhibitor pegcetacoplan with optical coherence tomography
(OCT)-based photoreceptor laminae thicknesses in this post hoc
analysis of the FILLY trial (NCT02503332). Retinal layers in OCT
were segmented using a deep-learning-based pipeline and
extracted along evenly spaced contour-lines surrounding areas of
GA. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline in
(standardized) outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness at the
5.16°-contour-line at month 12. Participants treated with
pegcetacoplan monthly had a thicker ONL along the 5.16°
contour-line compared to the pooled sham arm (mean difference
[95% CI] + 0.29 z-score units [0.16, 0.42], P < 0.001). The
same was evident for eyes treated with pegcetacoplan every other
month (+ 0.26 z-score units [0.13, 0.4], P < 0.001).
Additionally, eyes treated with pegcetacoplan exhibited a
thicker photoreceptor inner segment layer along the
5.16°-contour-line at month 12. These findings suggest that
pegcetacoplan could slow GA progression and lead to reduced
thinning of photoreceptor layers beyond the GA boundary. Future
trials in earlier disease stages, i.e., intermediate AMD, aiming
to slow photoreceptor degeneration warrant consideration.},
