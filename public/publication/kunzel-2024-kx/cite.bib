 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to determine how
structural and functional parameters influence the
vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in patients suffering
from geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular
degeneration. DESIGN: This study was designed as a prospective,
noninterventional, natural-history study (Directional Spread in
Geographic-Atrophy study, NCT02051998). SUBJECTS: The research
involved 82 patients with bilateral GA. METHODS: The study
examined parameters including GA location as assessed by the
ETDRS grid, best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual
acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed. These parameters were
then correlated with VRQoL, which was gauged using the National
Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25. The analysis
method employed was the least absolute shrinkage and selection
operator with linear mixed-effects models. MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURES: The central parameters measured in this study
encompassed GA area, VRQoL scores associated with different GA
subfields, and the significance of LLVA for foveal-sparing
patients. RESULTS: On average, patients showed a total GA area
of 2.9 $±$ 1.2 mm2 in the better eye (BE) and 3.1 $±$ 1.3
mm2 in the worse eye. The most significant associations with
VRQoL scores for distance and near activities were observed in
the inner lower and inner left subfields of the BE,
respectively. For patients with foveal-sparing GA, the LLVA of
the BE stood out as the most influential variable across all
VRQoL scales. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings point toward the
pivotal role of GA location, especially the inner lower and
inner left subfields of the BE, in relation to VRQoL in GA
patients. The LLVA's importance becomes even more pronounced for
foveal-sparing patients. These observations highlight the need
for health care professionals to better understand the
association between lesion location and patient-reported
outcomes. This is critical for informing treatment decisions and
refining the planning of interventional trials. FINANCIAL
