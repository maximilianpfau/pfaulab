 abstract = {PURPOSE: To describe imaging features of Macular Telangiectasia
Type 2 (MacTel) eyes experiencing ellipsoid zone (EZ) recovery.
METHODS: MacTel patients with EZ-recovery were identified from
the Natural History and Observational Registry Study and
underwent retinal imaging including optical coherence tomography
(OCT) and fundus photography. Eyes were graded according to the
classification system by Gass and Blodi, the EZ-loss area was
measured and OCT parameters were assessed by two independent
readers. Parameters were analysed for their presence prior to
EZ-recovery. RESULTS: Twenty-four eyes of 21 patients (12 female,
57.12%; mean age 68 $±$ 8.54 years) were included in this
study and followed for 21.25 $±$ 12.79 months. At baseline,
mean EZ-loss area was 0.036 $±$ 0.028 mm2 and 0.01 $±$ 0.013
mm2 at follow-up (p<0.001). A persisting external limiting
membrane overlaying the EZ-loss was detected in 16 cases (66%)
and hyperreflective changes in the outer retina were present in
18 cases (75%). Best corrected visual acuity was 0.23 (20/32)
$±$ 0.33 logMar at baseline and 0.34 (20/40) $±$ 0.34 logMar
at follow up (p=0.3). CONCLUSION: Distinct OCT features precede
ellipsoid zone recovery in MacTel and warrant further studies
investigating implications for patient care and clinical trial
interpretation.},
