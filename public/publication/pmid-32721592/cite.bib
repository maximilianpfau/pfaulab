Annual follow-up visits were performed over a 3-year period.\\ Pointwise correlation of retinal sensitivity stimuli to corresponding standardized (Z score) pointwise retinal thickness. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to analyze longitudinally the association of pointwise retinal thickness changes, follow-up time, or both with retinal function.\\ 0.001).\\ The longitudinal structure-function correlation demonstrated a progressive quantifiable degeneration of the outer retina in iAMD associated with photoreceptor dysfunction. Because longitudinal sensitivity changes could not be explained by structural changes alone, an unmet need remains for additional refined parameters on retinal structure to predict retinal function.},
