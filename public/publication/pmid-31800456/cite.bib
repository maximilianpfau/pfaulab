 abstract = {To evaluate dark adaptation (DA) in patients with macular telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel).\\ eccentricity horizontal from the foveal center within the temporal parafovea. Cone plateau, rod intercept time, and rod recovery rate (S2) were calculated from the resulting DA curves. Findings were correlated with disease stages (according to Gass and Blodi), the area of ellipsoid zone loss in optical coherence tomography, and macular pigment loss ("MP-Classes 1-3").\\ 0.0001).\\ Dark adaptation is significantly impaired in patients with MacTel. Our results indicate an association of reduced macular pigment and rod dysfunction in MacTel.},
