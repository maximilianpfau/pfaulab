 abstract = {Purpose: To quantify choriocapillaris flow alterations in
patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) in pre-atrophic
stages and its association with structural changes of the choroid
and outer retina. Methods: Thirty-two eyes of 21 patients with
PXE and 35 healthy eyes of 35 controls were included. The density
of choriocapillaris flow signal deficits (FDs) was quantified on
6 $\times$ 6-mm optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA)
images. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
images were analyzed for thicknesses of the choroid and outer
retinal microstructure and correlated with choriocapillaris FDs
in the respective Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study
subfield. Results: The multivariable mixed model analysis for
choriocapillaris FDs revealed significantly higher FDs associated
with the group (PXE patients vs. controls +13.6; 95% confidence
interval [CI] 9.87-17.3; P < 0.001), with increasing age (+0.22%
per year; 95% CI 0.12-0.33; P < 0.001), and with retinal
location (significantly higher FDs in nasal compared to temporal
subfields). Choroidal thickness (CT) did not differ significantly
between both groups (P = 0.078). The CT and choriocapillaris FDs
were inversely correlated (-1.92 µm per %FDs; interquartile
range -2.81 to -1.03; P < 0.001). Larger values of the
choriocapillaris FDs were associated with significant thinning of
the overlying photoreceptor layers (outer segments: -0.21 µm per
%FDs, P < 0.001; inner segments: -0.12 µm per %FDs, P = 0.001;
outer nuclear layer: -0.72 µm per %FDs; P < 0.001). Conclusions:
Patients with PXE display significant alterations of the
choriocapillaris on OCTA even in pre-atrophic stages and in the
absence of significant choroidal thinning. The analysis favors
choriocapillaris FDs over choroidal thickness as a potential
early outcome measure for future interventional trials in PXE.
Further, increased FDs in nasal compared to temporal locations
mirror the centrifugal spread of Bruch's membrane calcification
in PXE.},
