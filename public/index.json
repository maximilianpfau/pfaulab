Dies zeigt sich vor allem an der Haut, den Augen und dem kardiovaskulären System. Ophthalmologisch äußert sich die Krankheit häufig früh durch eine langsamere Anpassung von heller auf dunkle Umgebung. In Spätstadien kommt es zur Neubildung von Gefäßen und Degeneration der Netzhaut. Systemisch leiden die Patienten unter frühzeitiger Atherosklerose und verminderter schmerzfreier Gehstrecke. Als erstes Zeichen, häufig schon in der Kindheit oder Jugend, zeigen sich Veränderungen an der Haut, vor allem im Hals- und Nackenbereich.\n“Ophthalmologisch kann PXE der altersabhängigen Makuladegeneration ähneln, tritt jedoch aufgrund der genetischen Ursache in der Regel früher auf.

DESIGN: Longitudinal, cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five participants with RPD and spectrum of AMD severity (including no AMD). METHODS: Multimodal imaging was graded by a reading center, including evaluation of color fundus imaging to assess AMD severity scores. Reticular pseudodrusen presence on OCT volumes was confirmed on en face imaging and the RPD extent was contoured on infrared images. One study eye per participant underwent rod-mediated dark adaptation, measuring rod intercept time (RIT) at 5° and, if needed, 12° superior to the fovea. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was RIT and OCT thickness measures which were correlated with RPD area. RESULTS: A total of 51 eyes had $≥$ 1 visit with RPD detected (mean follow-up, 2.19 $±$ 2.04 years; range, 0-5 years), totaling 169 eye-based visits with RPD. Of the 51 eyes with RPD, 5 (9.8%) developed geographic atrophy and 17 (33.3%) progressed to neovascular AMD. Larger RPD areas were detected more frequently in AMD severity scores 6-7. Reticular pseudodrusen area within an eye generally increased over time. The lesion distribution showed a predilection for the superior retina, especially the outer superior subfield of the ETDRS grid, with the central subfield having least involvement. Reticular pseudodrusen area was inversely correlated with central subfield thickness and positively correlated with RIT at 5° (P = 0.001; r2 = 0.01) and 12° (P = 0.004; r2 = 0.01). Rod-mediated dark adaptation at 5° reached the test ceiling in  85% of visits, irrespective of RPD lesion presence/absence at the test location. Retinal thickness decreased monotonically, with the central subfield demonstrating the greatest percentage change over 5 years ($Δ$ = -5.47%). CONCLUSIONS: In AMD, RPD involve predominantly the superior retina but can involve all ETDRS subfields and evolve over time. Eyes with RPD exhibit structural and functional impairments that can be measured beyond the boundaries of the RPD lesions, suggesting changes associated with RPD are associated with both local changes and a more widespread process.

Mutations in the ABCC6-gene are causative, coding for a transmembrane transporter mainly expressed in hepatocytes, which promotes the efflux of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). This results in low levels of plasma inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a critical anti-mineralization factor. The clinical phenotype of PXE is characterized by the effects of elastic fiber calcification in the skin, the cardiovascular system, and the eyes. In the eyes, calcification of Bruch's membrane results in clinically visible lesions, including peau d'orange, angioid streaks, and comet tail lesions. Frequently, patients must be treated for secondary macular neovascularization. No effective therapy is available for treating the cause of PXE, but several promising approaches are emerging. Finding appropriate outcome measures remains a significant challenge for clinical trials in this slowly progressive disease. This review article provides an in-depth summary of the current understanding of PXE and its multi-systemic manifestations. The article offers a detailed overview of the ocular manifestations, including their morphological and functional consequences, as well as potential complications. Lastly, previous and future clinical trials of causative treatments for PXE are discussed.","tags":["Abcc6; bruch's membrane; pxe; pseudoxanthoma elasticum"],"title":"Pseudoxanthoma elasticum - Genetics, pathophysiology, and clinical presentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristin Raming","Maximilian Pfau","Philipp Herrmann","Frank G Holz","Kristina Pfau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1711929600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425284,"objectID":"26df068d89b02a546c5ec5ee05f8183f","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/raming-2024-td/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:22.777628Z","relpermalink":"/publication/raming-2024-td/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To assess the onset, treatment frequency, and visual outcome of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment due to secondary choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).

The assessment of CNV activity relied on hemorrhage visible on funduscopy and intra- / subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT), individually defining a shortening or extension of treatment interval. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, age at anti-VEGF therapy initiation, and BCVA-drop events at exudation onset (worsening of BCVA of 2 or more lines) were documented. Further, we assessed the number of injections during the first year and the total number of injections, the time to treatment initiation of the fellow eye, and BCVA over time.

Lens status is crucial since the ageing lens has both light-blocking and autofluorescence (AF) properties that distort image analysis. Here, we report both lens opacification and AF metrics and the effect on automated image quality assessment. METHODS: 227 subjects (range: 19-89 years old) received quantitative AF of the lens (LQAF), Scheimpflug, anterior chamber optical coherence tomography as well as blue/green FAF (BAF/GAF), and infrared (IR) imaging. LQAF values, the Pentacam Nucleus Staging score and the relative lens reflectivity were extracted to estimate lens opacification. Mean opinion scores of FAF and IR image quality were compiled by medical readers. A regression model for predicting image quality was developed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Correlation analysis was conducted to assess the association of lens scores, with retinal image quality derived from human or CNN annotations. RESULTS: Retinal image quality was generally high across all imaging modalities (IR (8.25$±$1.99) GAF BAF (6.6$±$3.13)). CNN image quality prediction was excellent (average mean absolute error (MAE) 0.9). Predictions were comparable to human grading. Overall, LQAF showed the highest correlation with image quality grading criteria for all imaging modalities (eg, Pearson correlation$±$CI -0.35 (-0.50 to 0.18) for BAF/LQAF). BAF image quality was most vulnerable to an increase in lenticular metrics, while IR (-0.19 (-0.38 to 0.01)) demonstrated the highest resilience. CONCLUSION: The use of CNN-based retinal image quality assessment achieved excellent results. The study highlights the vulnerability of BAF to lenticular remodelling. These results can aid in the development of cut-off values for clinical studies, ensuring reliable data collection for the monitoring of retinal diseases.","tags":["Imaging; lens and zonules; macula; retina"],"title":"Impact of lens autofluorescence and opacification on retinal imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lukas Goerdt","Kristin Raming","José Luis Rodriguez Garcia","Kristina Pfau","Frank G Holz","Philipp Herrmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1709251200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425188,"objectID":"7fab0eb104773a30e4440264aece29bc","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/goerdt-2024-ui/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:47.349273Z","relpermalink":"/publication/goerdt-2024-ui/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To describe imaging features of Macular Telangiectasia Type 2 (MacTel) eyes experiencing ellipsoid zone (EZ) recovery.

However, in elderly people, lens opacification varies strongly between individuals of similar age, and innate lens autofluorescence is not included in the current correction formula. Our goal was to develop and compare an individualized formula. Methods: One hundred thirty participants were examined cross-sectionally, and a subset of 30 participants received additional multimodal imaging 2-week post-cataract-surgery. Imaging included the Scheimpflug principle, anterior chamber optical coherence tomography (AC-OCT), lens quantitative autofluorescence (LQAF), and retinal QAF imaging.

Subsequently, a spline mixed model was applied to the whole cohort to quantify the influence of LQAF and Scheimpflug on QAF. Results: Age and LQAF measurements were found to be the most relevant variables, whereas AC-OCT measurements and Scheimpflug were eliminated by backward selection.

DESIGN: This study was designed as a prospective, noninterventional, natural-history study (Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy study, NCT02051998). SUBJECTS: The research involved 82 patients with bilateral GA. METHODS: The study examined parameters including GA location as assessed by the ETDRS grid, best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed. These parameters were then correlated with VRQoL, which was gauged using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25. The analysis method employed was the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with linear mixed-effects models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The central parameters measured in this study encompassed GA area, VRQoL scores associated with different GA subfields, and the significance of LLVA for foveal-sparing patients. RESULTS: On average, patients showed a total GA area of 2.9 $±$ 1.2 mm2 in the better eye (BE) and 3.1 $±$ 1.3 mm2 in the worse eye. The most significant associations with VRQoL scores for distance and near activities were observed in the inner lower and inner left subfields of the BE, respectively. For patients with foveal-sparing GA, the LLVA of the BE stood out as the most influential variable across all VRQoL scales. CONCLUSIONS: The study's findings point toward the pivotal role of GA location, especially the inner lower and inner left subfields of the BE, in relation to VRQoL in GA patients. The LLVA's importance becomes even more pronounced for foveal-sparing patients. These observations highlight the need for health care professionals to better understand the association between lesion location and patient-reported outcomes. This is critical for informing treatment decisions and refining the planning of interventional trials.

Hess)\n Unsere drei wichtigsten Publikationen im Jahr 2023 1. Frühste Gefäßveränderungen bei Pseudoxanthoma elasticum  Loewinger, A. S., Pfau, M., Herrmann, P., Holz, F. G., \u0026amp; Pfau, K. (2023). Choriocapillaris Flow Signal Impairment in Patients With Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum. Investigative ophthalmology \u0026amp; visual science, 64(2), 21. https://doi.org/10.1167/iovs.64.2.21\n Hintergrund: Eine genaue Messung der Kalzifizierung der Bruch‘schen Membran im Auge würde die Durchführung von zukünftigen Studien deutlich erleichtern. . Klinisch zeigt sich eine Veränderung der darunterliegenden Gefäßschicht (Choroidea). Die Messung der Kapillarschicht (Choriokapillaris) ist jedoch technisch herausfordernd\nInnovation: Ziel der Studie war es, die Veränderungen des Choriocapillaris-Flusses bei Patienten mit Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) im präatrophischen Stadium zu messen und ihren Zusammenhang mit strukturellen Veränderungen der Aderhaut sowie der äußeren Netzhaut zu untersuchen. Mittels optischen Kohärenztomographie-Angiographie (OCTA) ließ sich zeigen, dass Patienten mit PXE sehr früh signifikante Veränderungen der Choriocapillaris zeigen (selbst in präatrophischen Stadien und bei normaler Aderhautdicke). Zudem korrelierte die Choriocapillaris Flussdichte mit der Dicke der darüberliegenden äußeren Netzhaut.\nBedeutung: Die Analyse der Choriocapillaris Flussdichte ist besser als die Aderhautdicke geeignet, um PXE in milden Krankheitsstadien zu beobachten. Die Choriocapillaris Flussdichte ist eventuell ein geeignetes Ergebnismaß für zukünftige Interventionsstudien und wird derzeit von uns weiter im Rahmen der PROPXE Studie untersucht (NCT05662085).\n2. Einfluss der Genetik auf den Verlust von Netzhautfunktion bei Morbus Stargardt  Pfau, M., Huryn, L. A., Boyle, M. P., Cukras, C. A., Zein, W. M., Turriff, A., Ullah, E., Hufnagel, R. B., Jeffrey, B.

American journal of ophthalmology, 253, 224–232. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2023.05.014\n Hintergrund: Für Morbus Stargardt (ABCA4-Retinopathie) sind vielfältige Sehfunktionstests beschrieben um den Verlauf zu dokumentieren. Ein systematischer Vergleich sämtlicher Sehfunktionstests fehlte allerdings bislang.\nInnovation: Diese Studie basierte auf der großen, prospektiven natürlichen Verlaufsstudie des National Institutes of Health (). Die Teilnehmer unterzogen sich während einer durchschnittlichen Nachbeobachtungszeit von 3,65 Jahren einer Vielzahl von Funktionstests. Wir konnten unter andrem zeigen, dass Mikroperimetrie (Gesichtsfeldtestung in der Makula) am empfindlichsten für Veränderungen war, jedoch nur bei einem Teil der Patienten durchführbar war. Über ein 5-Jahres-Intervall war die Amplitude der dunkel-adaptierten a-Welle im Elektroretinogramm ebenfalls empfindlich für das Fortschreiten der Krankheit. Der Genotyp erklärte einen großen Teil der Variabilität der Veränderungen im Elektroretinogramm.\nBedeutung: Die Arbeit ist der bislang umfangreichste Vergleich von Sehfunktionstests bei Morbus Stargardt. Gerade in Patienten mit fortgeschrittener Erkrankung, bei denen die meisten Sehfunktionstests nicht mehr durchführbar sind, kann das Elektroretinogramm angewandt werden, um den Verlauf zu quantifizieren.\n3.

Following a brief break (approximately 5 minutes), the participants were bleached again and underwent dark-adaptometry testing with the S-MAIA device (same loci). In the retest reliability-substudy, participants were tested twice with the S-MAIA device (same loci as above). Nonlinear curve fitting was applied to extract dark-adaptation curve parameters. Validity and repeatability were summarized in terms of the mean bias and 95% limits of agreement (LoAs). Results: In the validation-substudy (N = 20 participants, median age interquartile range [IQR] 31.5 years [IQR = 25.8, 62.0]), measures of rod-mediated dark-adaptation showed little to no between method differences for the cone-rod-break-time (bias 95% confidence interval [95% CI] of +0.1 minutes [95% CI = -0.6 to 0.8]), rod-intercept-time (-0.23 minutes [95% CI = -1.38 to 0.93]), and S2 slope (-0.01 LogUnits/minutes [95% CI = -0.02 to -0.01]). In the retest reliability-substudy (N = 10 participants, 32.0 years [95% CI = 27.0, 57.5]), the corresponding LoAs were (cone-rod-break-time) -3.94 to 2.78 minutes, (rod-intercept-time) -4.55 to 3.11 minutes, and (S2 slope [rate-limited component of rod recovery]) -0.03 to 0.03 LogUnits/minutes. The LoAs for the steady-state cone and rod thresholds were -0.28 to 0.33 LogUnits and -0.34 to 0.28 LogUnits. Conclusions: The devised fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry method yields valid and reliable results. Translational Relevance: Fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry solves the critical need for localized testing of the visual cycle and retinoid transfer in eyes with unstable fixation.","tags":[],"title":"Establishing fully-automated fundus-controlled dark adaptometry: A validation and retest-reliability study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Marlene Saßmannshausen","Martina Braun","Verena Steffen","Simon S Gao","Lee Honigberg","Daniela Ferrara","Maximilian Pfau","Frank G Holz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1701388800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425289,"objectID":"0a806e209cfa5c2bcc709d7d3a270d8b","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/schmitz-valckenberg-2023-ji/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:27.811198Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schmitz-valckenberg-2023-ji/","section":"publication","summary":"OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability to evaluate changes over time of individual lesions of incomplete or complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA and cRORA, respectively) in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: OCT images from patients enrolled in Proxima B clinical trial (NCT02399072) were utilized. PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in the Proxima B clinical trial, from the cohort with geographic atrophy (GA) in 1 eye and iAMD in the other eye at baseline, were included. METHODS: Junior and senior readers analyzed OCT images for the qualitative presence of 9 distinct early atrophic features (presence of zone of choroidal hypertransmission, attenuation and/or disruption of RPE, disruption of ellipsoid zone [EZ] and external limiting membrane [ELM], outer nuclear layer [ONL] thinning, outer plexiform layer [OPL]/inner nuclear layer [INL] subsidence, and hyporeflective wedge-shaped band). If deemed ``present,'' 7 features were quantified with a predefined tolerance level of 50 $μ$m (diameter for the zone of choroidal hypertransmission, zone of attenuation and/or disruption of the RPE, outer retinal thickness left/right vertical diameter, outer retinal thickness thinnest vertical diameter, annotation of EZ, and ELM disruption). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interreader agreements for qualitative assessments ($ąppa$-type statistics) and quantitative measurements (Bland-Altman statistics) were assessed. Progression of the lesion features over time was described. RESULTS: Moderate agreement was found for presence of choroidal hypertransmission ($p̨pa$ = 0.54), followed by ELM disruption ($kp̨a$ = 0.58), OPL/INL subsidence ($kaą$ = 0.46), and a hyporeflective wedge-shaped band ($kap$̨ = 0.47). Quantification measurements showed that choroidal hypertransmission had the highest agreement, whereas RPE attenuation/disruption had the lowest agreement. Longitudinal adjudicated changes for quantitative measurements of lesion progression showed that choroidal hypertransmission and ELM disruption showed significant progression, whereas EZ disruption and RPE attenuation/disruption did not. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to evaluate changes over time for specific features of iRORA and cRORA was explored. The most robust biomarker was found to be choroidal hypertransmission, followed by ELM disruption and the qualitative markers of OPL/INL subsidence, as well as a wedge-shaped band. Disease progression over time could be assessed by some, but not all, spectral-domain OCT features that were explored.

Methods: This prospective, non-interventional, natural-history 'Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy' study was conducted at the University Eye Hospital in Bonn, enrolling 82 patients with bilateral GA. Parameters such as GA location (assessed by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed were examined. The association between these parameters and VRQoL, as gauged using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25), was analyzed through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with linear mixed-effects models. Results: The average total GA area observed was 2.9 $±$ 1.2 mm2 (better eye) and 3.1 $±$ 1.3 mm2 (worse eye). The VRQoL scores for distance and near activities were most associated with the inner lower and inner left subfields of the better eye. For foveal-sparing patients, the LLVA of the better eye was the predominant determinate impacting all VRQoL scales. Conclusion: GA location, specifically the inner lower and inner left subfields of the better eye, has a notable effect on VRQoL in GA patients. LLVA stands out as especially vital in foveal-sparing patients, underscoring the importance for clinicians to incorporate considerations of GA location and functional parameters into their risk-benefit assessments for emerging treatments.","tags":[],"title":"Impact of lesion location and functional parameters on vision-related quality of life in geographic atrophy secondary to AMD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristina Pfau","Brett G Jeffrey","Catherine A Cukras"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1693526400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425209,"objectID":"853b863402a0861ec7b74bc5a99119d1","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2023-fx/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:08.548168Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2023-fx/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the functional impact of oral vitamin A supplementation in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration with and without reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) demonstrating dysfunction in dark adaptation.

DESIGN: Prospective natural history study (NCT01736293). METHODS: Patients with at least 1 documented pathogenic ABCA4 variant and a clinical phenotype consistent with ABCA4 retinopathy were recruited from a tertiary referral center. Participants underwent longitudinal, multifaceted functional testing, including measures of function at fixation (best-corrected visual acuity, low-vision Cambridge Color Test), macular function (microperimetry), and retina-wide function (full-field electroretinography [ERG]). Two- and 5-year ability to detect change was determined based on the $η$2 statistic. RESULTS: A total of 134 eyes from 67 participants with a mean follow-up of 3.65 years were included. In the 2-year interval, the microperimetry-derived perilesional sensitivity ($η$2 of 0.73 [0.53, 0.83]; -1.79 dB/y [-2.2, -1.37]) and mean sensitivity ($η$2 of 0.62 [0.38, 0.76]; -1.28 dB/y [-1.67, -0.89]) showed most change over time, but could only be recorded in 71.6% of the participants. In the 5-year interval, the dark-adapted ERG a- and b-wave amplitude showed marked change over time as well (eg, DA 30 a-wave amplitude with an $η$2 of 0.54 [0.34, 0.68]; -0.02 log10(µV)/y [-0.02, -0.01]). The genotype explained a large fraction of variability in the ERG-based age of disease initiation (adjusted R2 of 0.73) CONCLUSIONS: Microperimetry-based clinical outcome assessments were most sensitive to change but could only be acquired in a subset of participants. Across a 5-year interval, the ERG DA 30 a-wave amplitude was sensitive to disease progression, potentially allowing for more inclusive clinical trial designs encompassing the whole ABCA4 retinopathy spectrum.","tags":["Stargardt disease","Abca4-associated retinopathy"],"title":"Natural history of visual dysfunction in ABCA4 retinopathy and its genetic correlates","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":null,"content":"Kristina Pfau hat am vergangenen Wochenende den Dr. Werner-Jackstädt Nachwuchsforschungspreis der Retinologischen Gesellschaft erhalten.

It is caused by mutations in one of the genes encoding collagen type IV. In recent years, new and innovative imaging techniques have added characteristics of ocular alterations in AS and provided new insights, including into the pathogenesis of the disease. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current knowledge of ocular changes in AS, as well as to present the Alport ocular pass. METHOD: Narrative review article. RESULTS: Ocular manifestations of AS include changes in the cornea, lens, and retina. Specifically, posterior polymorphic corneal dystrophy, anterior lenticonus (pathognomonic for AS), and various retinal changes have been described, which have been further characterized in recent years by newer imaging techniques. In particular, foveal changes in AS may present as both a thickened central retina in the context of foveal hypoplasia or a staircase-like thinning of the fovea. Both lesions could provide further insights into the role of type IV collagen in ocular structures. CONCLUSION: The AS can manifest in various structures of the eye. The staircase-like changes of the central retina in AS patients indicate the important role of collagen type IV in the homeostasis and regular function of the inner retinal layers. The often mild foveal hypoplasia may provide clues to the role of collagen type IV in retinal embryogenesis. While anterior lenticonus is pathognomonic for AS and can be treated easily by refractive lens exchange, the only option currently available for retinal alterations is close follow-up and, if necessary, treatment of systemic complications of AS.","tags":["Anterior lenticonus; dot-and-fleck maculopathy; foveal hypoplasia; nephrology; type iv collagen"],"title":"Okuläre Veränderungen bei Patienten mit Alport-Syndrom -- ein Update","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Saßmannshausen","Charlotte Behning","Jonas Weinz","Lukas Goerdt","Jan H Terheyden","Petrus Chang","Matthias Schmid","Stephen H Poor","Nadia Zakaria","Robert P Finger","Frank G Holz","Maximilian Pfau","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Sarah Thiele","MACUSTAR Consortium Members"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1682899200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425175,"objectID":"fc732c5b38898b7260412dd526bd508d","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/sasmannshausen-2023-sl/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:34.101348Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sasmannshausen-2023-sl/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To report the prevalence and topographic distribution of structural characteristics in study participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and controls in the cross-sectional study part of the MACUSTAR study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03349801).

SUBJECTS: Overall, 301 eyes of 301 subjects with early (n = 34), intermediate (n = 168), and late AMD (n = 43), as well as eyes without any AMD features (n = 56). METHODS: In study eyes with intermediate AMD (iAMD), the presence of structural AMD biomarkers, including pigmentary abnormalities (PAs), pigment epithelium detachment (PED), refractile deposits, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), hyperreflective foci (HRF), incomplete/complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and outer retinal atrophy (i/cRORA), and quiescent choroidal neovascularization (qCNV) was systematically determined in the prospectively acquired multimodal retinal imaging cross-sectional data set of MACUSTAR. Retinal layer thicknesses and the RPE drusen complex (RPEDC) volume were determined for the total study cohort in spectral-domain (SD) OCT imaging using a deep-learning-based algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and topographic distribution of structural iAMD features. RESULTS: A total of 301 study eyes of 301 subjects with a mean ($±$ standard deviation) age of 71.2 $±$ 7.20 years (63.1% women) were included. Besides large drusen, the most prevalent structural feature in iAMD study eyes were PA (57.1%), followed by HRF (51.8%) and RPD (22.0%). Pigment epithelium detachment lesions were observed in 4.8%, vitelliform lesions in 4.2%, refractile deposits in 3.0%, and qCNV in 2.4%. Direct precursor lesions for manifest retinal atrophy were detected in 10.7% (iRORA) and 4.2% (cRORA) in iAMD eyes. Overall, the highest RPEDC volume with a median of 98.92 $times$ 10-4 mm³ was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial analysis demonstrated a predominant distribution of RPD in the superior and temporal subfields at a foveal eccentricity of 1.5 to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct topographic distribution involving the foveal center. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD biomarkers is vital to identify reliable outcome measure for disease progression.

METHODS: Ninety-three eyes of 66 patients (mean age 71.9 $±$ 11.1) with uni- or bilateral PED ( $≥$ 350 µm) were included in a retrospective cross-sectional study. PEDs were secondary to age-related macular degeneration (n = 79), central serous chorioretinopathy (n = 7), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n = 2), pattern dystrophy (n = 3) or idiopathic PED (n = 2). FAF images were recorded using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (488 nm excitation wavelength, detection of emission 500 nm). Diagnosis of PED was confirmed using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A qualitative FAF grading system was established, and grading was performed by two independent readers. RESULTS: PEDs showed highly variable characteristics on FAF imaging. FAF within the area of PED was found to be irregular/granular (n = 59, 63.4%), increased (n = 28, 30.1%), decreased (n = 3, 3.2 %), or normal (n = 3, 3.2%).

In this study, we aimed to evaluate differences and similarities that may point toward underlying mechanisms linking both disease entities. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross sectional study. SUBJECTS: Patients diagnosed with MacTel or TR. METHODS: Patients underwent multimodal retinal imaging, including color fundus photography, spectral-domain OCT, fundus autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and OCT angiography (if available). Age, age of onset, best-corrected visual acuity, and bilaterality of changes were evaluated. Patients' eyes were graded for different morphologic characteristics by 4 experienced graders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phenotypical characterization and comparison of frequencies of retinal characteristics of TR and MacTel on multimodal imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients with TR and 118 eyes of 59 patients with MacTel were included. Age, age of onset, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar in both cohorts. All but 1 patient showed bilateral changes. In patients with MacTel, neurodegenerative changes and vascular alterations were equally present, whereas in patients with TR, neurodegenerative changes usually prevailed. Predilection sites within the central retina differed between the 2 diseases: most findings in patients with TR were limited to the foveal center, whereas changes in patients with MacTel were present throughout a slightly larger region (``MacTel area''), with an epicenter temporal to the foveal center. Distinct morphologic features included the distribution of retinal crystals, the size and position of ellipsoid zone breaks, and the presence of hyperreflective changes on OCT images. Focal hyperpigmentation and neovascular membranes were only present in eyes with MacTel. CONCLUSIONS: Macular telangiectasia and TR share a highly similar retinal phenotype, especially in early disease stages. Subtle differences on multimodal retinal images may help distinguish between these 2 disease entities. Our findings indicate the involvement of Müller cells in both diseases, which may explain the observed phenotypic characteristics and similarities.","tags":["Mactel; macular telangiectasia type 2; multimodal imaging; retinal imaging; retinal phenotyping; tamoxifen retinopathy"],"title":"Tamoxifen retinopathy and macular telangiectasia type 2: Similarities and differences on multimodal retinal imaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":null,"content":"For the natural history study PRO-PXE (Progression Rate of Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum-associated Choroidal and Retinal Degeneration), the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital Basel is currently recruiting volunteers with PXE.\nLinks: German version; French version; Italian version\nPurpose of the study This study aims to systematically compare new visual function tests and new ophthalmic imaging techniques to monitor the natural history of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).\nCurrently, several drugs are evaluated in trials for treating PXE.

It is caused by biallelic ABCA4 variants, and no treatment is available to date. STGD1 shows marked phenotypic variability, especially regarding the age of onset. The underlying genotype can partially explain this variability. Notably, a subset of ABCA4 variants was previously associated with an earlier disease onset than truncating ABCA4 variants, pointing toward pathogenic mechanisms beyond the loss of gene function in these patients. On the other end of the spectrum, variants such as p.Gly1961Glu were associated with markedly slower extrafoveal disease progression. Given that these drastic differences in phenotype are based on genotype (resulting in important prognostic implications for patients), this chapter reviews previous approaches to genotype-phenotype correlation analyses in STGD1.","tags":["Abca4-associated retinopathy; disease progression; genotype; genotype-phenotype correlation; stargardt disease"],"title":"Genotype-phenotype association in ABCA4-associated retinopathy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":null,"content":"Vielen herzlichen Dank!

Für die Bewertung der Dunkeladaptation gibt es mehrere klinische Kennzahlen, die bislang nur unzureichend verglichen wurden.\nInnovation: Diese Untersuchung – der eine natürliche Verlaufsstudie am National Eye Institute beruht (Projektleiter: Catherine A. Cukras, MD, PhD) zu Grunde liegt – wies nach, dass die ‚Rod-Intercept-Time‘ (Zeit, bis die Netzhaut-Sensitivität wieder einen bestimmten Schwellenwert erreicht) sich am besten wiederholt messen lässt und den engsten Zusammenhang mit der Krankheitsprogression zeigt. Weiterhin zeigte diese Arbeit in einer großen, longitudinalen Kohorte, dass sich eine eingeschränkte Funktion von Zapfen-Photorezeptoren (Zellen für das Tagsehen) erst im Verlauf messen lässt.\nBedeutung: Diese Veröffentlichung trägt maßgeblich zum Verständnis der zeitlichen Abfolge des Funktionsverlust bei altersabhängiger Makuladegeneration ein.

We compared automated drusen volume measurements between different OCT devices.

Sensitivity and specificity for drusen detection and differences between modalities were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and mean difference in a 5 mm diameter fovea-centered circle. Specificity was  90% in the three modalities. In eAMD, we observed highest sensitivity in the denser Spectralis scan (68.1). The two different Spectralis modalities showed a significantly higher agreement in quantifying drusen volume in iAMD (ICC 0.993 [0.991-0.994]) than the dense Spectralis with Cirrus scan (ICC 0.807 [0.757-0.847]). Formulae for drusen volume conversion in iAMD between the two devices are provided. Automated drusen volume measures are not interchangeable between devices and softwares and need to be interpreted with the used imaging devices and software in mind. Accounting for systematic difference between methods increases comparability and conversion formulae are provided.

DESIGN: Prospective, longitudinal study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01352975). PARTICIPANTS: A total of 191 patients with AMD and older participants followed longitudinally over 5 years. METHODS: Dark adaptation testing was performed using the AdaptDx dark adaptometer with a maximum test time of 40 minutes. A 2-part exponential-linear curve was fitted to obtain values for cone decay, cone plateau, time to rod-cone break, rod intercept time (RIT), rod adaptation rate (S2), and area under the curve. Intersession retest reliability was assessed in tests performed within 2 weeks using the Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship of DA parameters with age, AMD severity, and reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) presence was evaluated using linear mixed models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retest reliability, association with disease severity, and longitudinal change of 6 DA parameters. RESULTS: A total of 1329 DA curves were analyzed. Rod intercept time was the parameter that showed the greatest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88) and greatest association with age, AMD severity, and RPD (marginal R2 of 0.38), followed by the rod-mediated parameters area under the curve and rod-cone break. Cone plateau appeared constant at lower RIT values but increased with progressive rod dysfunction (RIT  22.8 minutes) with a slope of 0.07 log units per 10 minutes RIT prolongation. Therefore, it might provide additional information in the advanced stages of AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related macular degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with large differences in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition, substantial differences in some parameters occur with age, even accounting for AMD severity and RPD status. This supports the 2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and perhaps AMD pathophysiology itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the highest retest reliability, closest correlation with AMD severity and RPD, and largest longitudinal changes. This underscores the suitability of RIT as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The cone plateau increases only in advanced stages of kinetic rod dysfunction, indicating rod dysfunction preceding cone dysfunction and degeneration in the temporal sequence of pathology in AMD.","tags":["Cone decay; cone plateau; dark adaptation; rod intercept time (rit); rod-cone break"],"title":"Evaluation of cone- and rod-mediated parameters in dark adaptation testing as outcome measures in age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Amisha D Dave","Kristina Hess","Katherine G Chen","Henry Wiley","Tiarnan D L Keenan","Elvira Agrón","Emily Y Chew","Catherine A Cukras"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1669852800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425176,"objectID":"41fe7774b01d101077d5aaeb290e6d17","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/dave-2022-af/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:35.170822Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dave-2022-af/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: To investigate potential associations between renal function and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) features as assessed with multimodal retinal imaging.

Morphological changes preceding the formation of neovascularisation were evaluated using colour fundus photography, infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular pigment measurement and optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT-angiography (OCT-A) images were additionally available in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eyes from 20 patients were examined over a median period of 17 months (range: 6-100 months). Eyes were characterised by an accelerated progression of ellipsoid zone loss (median of 0.013 mm2/month), increased thickness of the temporal parafovea and hyper-reflective lesions on OCT. The latter underwent morphological changes preceding the development of exudative neovascularisation, including an increase in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a foveal depletion of macular pigment. On OCT-A, a focal increase in blood flow was observed at the level of the outer retina/choriocapillaris, and retinal-retinal and retinal-choroidal anastomoses preceded the formation of exudative neovascularisation.

Results: The two models had comparable goodness-of-fit measures, with root mean squared error (RMSE; SD) = 0.11 (0.04) log-units (LU) for the classical model and RMSE = 0.13 (0.06) LU for the DL model. Repeatability of the curve fits evaluated after introduction of random perturbations, and after performing repeated testing, demonstrated superiority of the DL method, especially among parameters related to cone decay. The DL method exhibited superior ability to predict the curve and RIT using points prior to -2 LU, with 3.1 $±$ 3.1 minutes RIT prediction error, compared to 19.1 $±$ 18.6 minutes RIT error for the classical method. Conclusions: The parameters obtained from the DL method demonstrated superior robustness as well as predictability of the curve. These could provide important advances in using multiple DA curve parameters to characterize AMD severity. Translational Relevance: Dark adaptation is an important functional measure in studies of AMD and curve modeling using DL methods can lead to improved clinical trial end points.","tags":[],"title":"Deep learning-based modeling of the dark adaptation curve for robust parameter estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Saßmannshausen","Charlotte Behning","Ben Isselmann","Matthias Schmid","Robert P Finger","Frank G Holz","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Maximilian Pfau","MACUSTAR Consortium","Sarah Thiele"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1661990400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425277,"objectID":"3f989c7be0f69fb583866900ee85c150","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/sasmannshausen-2022-hi/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:16.593357Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sasmannshausen-2022-hi/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantification of the relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity (rEZR) might be a structural surrogate parameter for an early disease progression in the context of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

In the fovea, the last area to be affected in choroideremia, we found greater disruption to the RPE than to either the photoreceptor or choriocapillaris layers. The unexpected finding of patches of photoreceptors that were fluorescently-labeled, but structurally and functionally normal, suggests that the RPE blood barrier function may be altered in choroideremia. Finally, we introduce a strategy for detecting enlarged cells using conventional ophthalmic imaging instrumentation.

This natural process also offers an opportunity to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate for presence of disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a key indicator of retinal health, which can be altered in the presence of certain diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of DA measurement and its significance to furthering our understanding of AMD has revealed essential findings underlying the pathobiology of the disease. The process of dark adaptation involves phototransduction taking place mainly between the photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer. DA occurs over a large range of luminance and is modulated by both cone and rod photoreceptors. In the photopic ranges, rods are saturated and cone cells adapt to the high luminance levels. However, under scotopic ranges, cones are unable to respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate the responses to lower levels of light as they can respond to even a single photon. Since the cone visual cycle is also based on the Muller cells, measuring the impairment in rod-based dark adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases such as AMD, which involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark adaptation parameters are metrics derived from curve-fitting dark adaptation sensitivities over time and can represent specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod break (CRB) and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly sensitive to changes in the outer retina. There is some structural and functional continuum between normal aging and the AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod intercept time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD patients with increasing disease severity determined by increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the presence of subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain morphological features in the peripheral retina. Specifications of spatial testing location, repeatability of the testing, ease and availability of the testing device in clinical settings, and test duration in elderly population are also important. We provide a detailed overview in light of all these factors.","tags":["Age-related macular degeneration (amd); cone-rod break (crb); dark adaptation (da); longitudinal monitoring; phototransduction; rod-intercept time (rit); spatial gradient; subretinal drusenoid deposits (sdd)"],"title":"Dark adaptation and its role in age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Saßmannshausen","Sarah Thiele","Charlotte Behning","Maximilian Pfau","Matthias Schmid","Sérgio Leal","Ulrich F O Luhmann","Robert P Finger","Frank G Holz","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","MACUSTAR Consortium"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1646092800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425262,"objectID":"46c860588a0f290b711b0bf7a25f1cfd","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/sasmannshausen-2022-xv/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:01.167493Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sasmannshausen-2022-xv/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: To analyze the intersession repeatability of structural biomarkers in eyes with early and intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) within the cross-sectional part of the observational multicenter MACUSTAR study. Methods: Certified site personnel obtained multimodal imaging data at two visits (38 $±$ 20 [mean $±$ standard deviation] days apart), including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). One junior reader performed systematic and blinded grading at the central reading center, followed by senior reader review. Structural biomarkers included maximum drusen size classification (63 to $łeq$125 µm vs. 125 µm), presence of large pigment epithelium detachments (PEDs), reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), vitelliform lesions, and refractile deposits. Intrasession variability was assessed using Cohen's $ąppa$ statistics. Results: At the first visit, 202 study eyes of 202 participants were graded as manifesting with either early (n = 34) or intermediate (n = 168) AMD. Grading of imaging data between visits revealed perfect agreement for the maximum drusen size classification ($p̨pa$ = 0.817; 95% confidence interval, 0.70-0.94). In iAMD eyes, perfect to substantial agreement was determined for the presence of large PEDs (0.87; 0.69-1.00) and RPD (0.752; 0.63-0.87), while intersession agreement was lower for the presence of vitelliform lesions (0.649; 0.39-0.65) and refractile deposits (0.342; -0.029-0.713), respectively. Conclusions: Multimodal retinal imaging analysis between sessions showed a higher repeatability for structural biomarkers with predefined cutoff values than purely qualitative defined parameters.

DESIGN: Interreader agreement study. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve readers from 6 reading centers. METHODS: After formal training, readers qualitatively assessed 60 OCT B-scans from 60 eyes with AMD for 9 individual features associated with early atrophy and performed 7 different annotations to quantify the spatial extent of OCT features within regions of interest. The qualitative and quantitative features were used to derive the presence of iRORA and cRORA and also in an exploratory analysis to examine if agreement could be improved using different combinations of features to define OCT atrophy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interreader agreement based on Gwet's first-order agreement coefficient (AC1) for qualitatively graded OCT features and classification of iRORA and cRORA, and smallest real difference (SRD) for quantitatively graded OCT features. RESULTS: Substantial or better interreader agreement was observed for all qualitatively graded OCT features associated with atrophy (AC1 = 0.63-0.87), except for RPE attenuation (AC1 = 0.46) and disruption (AC1 = 0.26). The lowest SRD for the quantitatively graded horizontal features was observed for the zone of choroidal hypertransmission ($±$ 190.8 $μ$m). Moderate agreement was found for a 3-category classification of no atrophy, iRORA, and cRORA (AC1 = 0.53). Exploratory analyses suggested a significantly higher level of agreement for a 3-category classification using (1) no atrophy; (2) presence of inner nuclear layer and outer plexiform layer subsidence, or a hyporeflective wedge-shaped band, as a less severe atrophic grade; and (3) the latter plus an additional requirement of choroidal hypertransmission of 250 $μ$m or more for a more severe atrophic grade (AC1 = 0.68; P = 0.013). CONCLUSIONS: Assessment of iRORA and cRORA, and most of their associated features, can be performed relatively consistently and robustly. A refined combination of features to define early atrophy could further improve interreader agreement.","tags":["Nascent geographic atrophy; outer retinal atrophy; reading center; retinal pigment epithelium; variability"],"title":"OCT signs of early atrophy in age-related macular degeneration: Interreader agreement: Classification of atrophy meetings report 6","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau","Catherine A Cukras","Laryssa A Huryn","Wadih M Zein","Ehsan Ullah","Marisa P Boyle","Amy Turriff","Michelle A Chen","Aarti S Hinduja","Hermann Ea Siebel","Robert B Hufnagel","Brett G Jeffrey","Brian P Brooks"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1640995200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425193,"objectID":"1934f217f15623f00acb140315d34d2e","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2022-mv/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:52.134769Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2022-mv/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUNDOutcome measures sensitive to disease progression are needed for ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4-associated (ABCA4-associated) retinopathy. We aimed to quantify ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss and photoreceptor degeneration beyond EZ-loss in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and investigate associations between photoreceptor degeneration, genotype, and age.METHODSWe analyzed 132 eyes from 66 patients (of 67 enrolled) with molecularly confirmed ABCA4-associated retinopathy from a prospective natural history study with a median [IQR] follow-up of 4.2 years [3.1, 5.1]. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (37 B-scans, 30° $times$ 15°) were segmented using a deep learning (DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype analysis, a model of ABCA4 variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss (6.25 mm2) as the dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an average (square-root-transformed) EZ-loss progression rate of [95% CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL thickness (to $±$2 z score units) was 3.20° [2.53, 3.87].

Emerging clinical trials require suitable end points. The characterization and validation of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is warranted. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively evaluate reading performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association with established visual function assessments and structural biomarkers. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The noninterventional, prospective natural history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and ended January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reading acuity and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts. Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy, followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association of those variables with reading performance. RESULTS: A total of 150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this study (median [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60%]; 34 men [40%]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR) monocular reading acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the reading acuity determination and a reading speed of 52.8 (0-123) words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis, best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest associations with reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity = 0.69). Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central ETDRS subfield, in the inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal analysis, a similar prediction accuracy for reading performance was determined (R2 for reading acuity = 0.73; R2 for reading speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular reading performance did not differ from reading performance in the better-seeing eye. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: The association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on the better-seeing eye.","tags":[],"title":"Association of reading performance in Geographic Atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration with visual function and structural biomarkers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau","Elon H C van Dijk","Thomas J van Rijssen","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Frank G Holz","Monika Fleckenstein","Camiel J F Boon"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1633046400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425246,"objectID":"c771bc7c949730e1d343be6e78413ba4","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2021-if/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:45.33105Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2021-if/","section":"publication","summary":"Refined understanding of the association of retinal microstructure with current and future (post-treatment) function in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) may help to identify patients that would benefit most from treatment.

We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in PubMed and Web of Science among others with the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)', 'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry, and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD, inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters, which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short FCP examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred retinal sensitivity, based on multimodal imaging, may be considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint for future interventional clinical trials in the future.","tags":[],"title":"AI-based structure-function correlation in age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Charlotte Behning","Monika Fleckenstein","Maximilian Pfau","Christine Adrion","Lukas Goerdt","Moritz Lindner","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Frank G Holz","Matthias Schmid"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425241,"objectID":"e532cc360d80716c614ce1d370d35ee1","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/behning-2021-cv/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:40.742443Z","relpermalink":"/publication/behning-2021-cv/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND: To model the progression of geographic atrophy (GA) in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by building a suitable statistical regression model for GA size measurements obtained from fundus autofluorescence imaging. METHODS: Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a linear mixed-effects model for GA size progression that incorporates covariable-dependent enlargement rates as well as correlations between longitudinally collected GA size measurements. To capture nonlinear progression in a flexible way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with different transformation parameters $łambda$. Model evaluation is performed on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective multi-center cohort studies on GA size progression. RESULTS: A transformation parameter of $łambda$=0.45 yielded the best model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were included as risk factors in the model, they showed an association with progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this model was 67.21$±$6.49 years. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive framework for modeling the course of uni- or bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal observational studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset estimation, identification of risk factors and prediction of future GA size.

METHODS: In a primary cross-sectional analysis, multimodal imaging data were retrospectively analyzed. The definition of hyperreflectivity and neovascularization on optical coherence tomography followed optical coherence tomography angiography-based criteria. Eyes were graded for the presence of hyperreflectivity and neovascularization and further categorized into three classes based on position and extent of hyperreflectivity. In a secondary analysis, eyes were reviewed for $≥$24 months using optical coherence tomography imaging. RESULTS: Three hundred and twenty-two eyes from 161 patients were analyzed in the cross-sectional analysis. Hyperreflectivity was found in 177 (55%) and neovascular membranes in 49 (15%) eyes. Hyperreflectivity correlated significantly with parameters indicative of disease progression. In the longitudinal analysis, 206 eyes from 103 patients were reviewed over a mean of 35.6 months. 17/86 eyes (20%) showed a de novo development of hyperreflectivity. 8/29 eyes (28%) with preexistent intraretinal hyperreflectivity developed outer retinal hyperreflectivity.

Methods: SD-OCT volume scans were segmented with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal thickness and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid). Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure. Results: In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094) using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across models. Conclusions: The proposed, fully automated pipeline enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in real-world settings.

This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases that initially spare the central retina in earlier disease stages. Improved intra- and inter-session retest-variability through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent key advantages of these technique. The design of disease-specific test patterns and protocols reduces the burden of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also allow for photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation of dark-adapted chromatic and photopic testing. A detailed understanding of the variety of available devices and test settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical trials. Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and technical background of FCP, its prior application in clinical and research settings, data that qualify the application of FCP as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as ongoing and future developments.","tags":["Age-related macular degeneration; fcp; functional outcome measures; inherited retinal diseases; inherited retinal dystrophy; microperimetry; retina"],"title":"Fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry): Application as outcome measure in clinical trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simone Tzaridis","Kristina Hess","Martin Friedlander","Frank G Holz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1619827200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425213,"objectID":"cc36e6547e9c01e624d32982b35eaef0","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/tzaridis-2021-dh/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:12.381417Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tzaridis-2021-dh/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of optical coherence tomography-angiography (OCT-A) for monitoring activity, progression and response to therapy of neovascularisations (NVs) secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: In a retrospective analysis, eyes with NVs secondary to MacTel were reviewed over a period of $≥$8 months. Examinations at monthly intervals included visual acuity testing, dilated funduscopy, spectral domain-OCT and OCT-A. Eyes were treated with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of activity as determined by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and haemorrhages. RESULTS: A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients were analysed. Patients were evaluated over a mean period of 13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted the monitoring of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth) of NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular vessels was detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity occurred on OCT. NVs showed a progressive growth over time despite PRN-treatment and preferentially grew and extended within areas characterised by a focal reduction of choriocapillaris perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that OCT-A represents a useful imaging modality for monitoring NV-progression and treatment effects in MacTel. We demonstrate its advantages over conventional B-scan OCT imaging, including an earlier detection of NV-progression, and propose an adjustment of the current OCT-controlled PRN treatment regime in order to prevent NV-progression and subsequent functional loss in neovascular MacTel.","tags":["Degeneration; imaging; macula; neovascularisation; retina"],"title":"Optical coherence tomography-angiography for monitoring neovascularisations in macular telangiectasia type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Maximilian Pfau","Monika Fleckenstein","Giovanni Staurenghi","Janet R Sparrow","Almut Bindewald-Wittich","Richard F Spaide","Sebastian Wolf","Srinivas R Sadda","Frank G Holz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1614556800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425158,"objectID":"59b4f607093edad7d1a85813751aaaea","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/schmitz-valckenberg-2021-kd/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:16.71752Z","relpermalink":"/publication/schmitz-valckenberg-2021-kd/","section":"publication","summary":"Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging is an in vivo imaging method that allows for topographic mapping of naturally or pathologically occurring intrinsic fluorophores of the ocular fundus.

The global progression rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45 dB/year (0.13 to 0.78) and was higher for the central and inner ETDRS subfields compared with more peripheral regions. CONCLUSIONS: Mesopic light sensitivity measured by FCP is reliable and susceptible for functional changes. It constitutes a potential clinical outcome for both natural history studies as well as future interventional studies in patients with STGD1.","tags":["Diagnostic tests/investigation; dystrophy; macula; retina"],"title":"Retinal light sensitivity as outcome measure in recessive Stargardt disease","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp L Müller","Alexandru Odainic","Tim Treis","Philipp Herrmann","Adnan Tufail","Frank G Holz","Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425235,"objectID":"f2b30efd44b7bd04f78c27003cb295b6","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/muller-2021-dc/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:33.908462Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muller-2021-dc/","section":"publication","summary":"Spatially-resolved retinal function can be measured by psychophysical testing like fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP or 'microperimetry'). It may serve as a performance outcome measure in emerging interventional clinical trials for macular diseases as requested by regulatory agencies. As FCP constitute laborious examinations, we have evaluated a machine-learning-based approach to predict spatially-resolved retinal function ('inferred sensitivity') based on microstructural imaging (obtained by spectral domain optical coherence tomography) and patient data in recessive Stargardt disease. Using nested cross-validation, prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 4.74 dB [4.48-4.99] were achieved. After additional inclusion of limited FCP data, the latter reached 3.89 dB [3.67-4.10] comparable to the test-retest MAE estimate of 3.51 dB [3.11-3.91]. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed, that the IS\u0026OS and RPE thickness were the most important features for the prediction of retinal sensitivity. 'Inferred sensitivity', herein, enables to accurately estimate differential effects of retinal microstructure on spatially-resolved function in Stargardt disease, and might be used as quasi-functional surrogate marker for a refined and time-efficient investigation of possible functionally relevant treatment effects or disease progression.","tags":[],"title":"Inferred retinal sensitivity in recessive Stargardt disease using machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp L Müller","Maximilian Pfau","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Monika Fleckenstein","Frank G Holz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425160,"objectID":"59f8de1ad1fffd3f0311a106281b578e","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/muller-2021-ue/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:19.042809Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muller-2021-ue/","section":"publication","summary":"Geographic atrophy (GA) represents the non-exudative late stage of age-related macular degeneration and constitutes a leading cause of legal blindness in the developed world. It is characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers including photoreceptors, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and rarefication of the choriocapillaris. As all three layers are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and relative contribution of these layers towards the development and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A, recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential protective effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis, study design, and patient assessment.","tags":["Age-related macular degeneration; angiography; choriocapillaris; choroid; optical coherence tomography"],"title":"Optical coherence tomography-angiography in geographic atrophy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Muriel B Huss","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Robert P Finger","Karin U Löffler","Monika Fleckenstein","Frank G Holz","Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425249,"objectID":"8138b4c2c1a8ef33b200f12f0e099d52","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/huss-2021-pk/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:47.773498Z","relpermalink":"/publication/huss-2021-pk/","section":"publication","summary":"INTRODUCTION: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the establishment of an eye donation registry represents a prerequisite for the acquisition of such data. METHODS: A total of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median and 25th (Q25) and 75th (Q75) percentiles. RESULTS: The majority of patients (77.0%) would agree to donate their eyes for research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye donation, 60.9% of all patients only stated reasons in the category ``addressable'' (e.g., not enough awareness of the topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1). CONCLUSION: Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given against postmortem eye donation were often related to misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research purposes.","tags":["Clinicopathological studies; histopathology; patient attitude; postmortem analysis"],"title":"The willingness of patients to participate in an eye donation registry for research","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristina Hess","Martin Gliem","Peter Charbel Issa","Johannes Birtel","Philipp L Müller","Leon von der Emde","Philipp Herrmann","Frank G Holz","Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425172,"objectID":"da1b225d5ccd1eaa6968a539f633f89f","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/hess-2020-wg/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:31.858486Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hess-2020-wg/","section":"publication","summary":"Importance: Correlates for Bruch membrane alterations are needed for interventional trials targeting the Bruch membrane in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Objectives: To quantify mesopic and scotopic light sensitivity and identify its microstructural correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane in patients with PXE. Design, Setting, and Participants: A prospective, single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February 20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was completed March 15, 2020. Exposures: Mesopic and dark-adapted 2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was performed using machine learning. Main Outcomes and Measures: Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss as measure of rod photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the accuracy of structure-function correlation. Results: Of the 22 patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were women (68%); median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2). These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95% CI, 2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95% CI, 6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95% CI, 4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was also evident in 9 eyes with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic: estimate, 3.21 dB; 95% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted cyan: 5.93 dB; 95% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing: 4.84 dB; 95% CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal pattern of sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91 dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor complex with sensitivity loss. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with overall dysfunction.","tags":[],"title":"Mesopic and scotopic light sensitivity and its microstructural correlates in pseudoxanthoma elasticum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp L Müller","Maximilian Pfau","Tim Treis","Isabel Pascual-Camps","Johannes Birtel","Moritz Lindner","Philipp Herrmann","Frank G Holz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425300,"objectID":"956115cae15a95887f496599b5f5133f","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/muller-2020-qy/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:38.922142Z","relpermalink":"/publication/muller-2020-qy/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic, functional, genetic, and imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium atrophy progression secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy.

A model was used to predict the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were performed to model the power in a simulated interventional study. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range, 14-78 years) with a follow-up time of 10 to 100 months were included. The mean annual progression of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic areas, the retina-wide functional impairment, and the age-of-onset category constituted significant predictors for future retinal pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining 25.7% of the variability.

Autofluorescence imaging with blue (BAF), green (GAF), and near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF imaging obtained by an innovative confocal light-emitting diode-based retinal imaging system (Color-AF) that allows for separation of short (green emission fluorescent component) and long (red emission fluorescent component) autofluorescence emission components. RESULTS: Color-AF, BAF, and GAF, overall, revealed similar presentation of hyperautofluorescent flecks. Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent component matched with hyperautofluorescent flecks in NIR-AF. Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months, flecks showed a transition in the AF emission spectrum to shorter wavelengths (red emission fluorescent component to green emission fluorescent component), associated with a progressed disruption of overlaying outer retinal bands in optical coherence tomography. Newer hyperautofluorescent flecks usually revealed predominantly red emission fluorescent component.

Recent developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented precision. OBJECTIVE: Which criteria must be considered for the evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology? MATERIAL AND METHODS: Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization). RESULTS: Based on nested cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE, 95% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]). Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]). CONCLUSION: Selection of an unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.","tags":["Automated analysis; deep learning; empirical approach; machine-learning; statistical learning"],"title":"Künstliche Intelligenz in der Augenheilkunde","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau","Leon von der Emde","Luis de Sisternes","Joelle A Hallak","Theodore Leng","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Frank G Holz","Monika Fleckenstein","Daniel L Rubin"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1601510400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425179,"objectID":"09287c9025ab8c448c6e8c01aa9c492d","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2020-ab/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:38.69754Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2020-ab/","section":"publication","summary":"Importance: Sensitive outcome measures for disease progression are needed for treatment trials in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD).

Design, Setting, and Participants: Monocenter cohort study (Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy [NCT02051998]) and analysis of data from a normative data study at a tertiary referral center. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of 89 patients with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years, median area of GA of 8.87 mm2 (IQR, 4.09-15.60), and median follow-up of 1.1 years (IQR, 0.52-1.7 years), as well as 93 normal eyes from 93 participants. Exposures: Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume scans (121 B-scans across 30° $times$ 25°) were segmented with a deep-learning pipeline and standardized in a pointwise manner with age-adjusted normal data (z scores). Outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor inner segment (IS), and outer segment (OS) thickness were quantified along evenly spaced contour lines surrounding GA lesions.

The fully automated B-scan segmentation was accurate (dice coefficient, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.85; compared with manual markings) and revealed a marked interpatient variability in photoreceptor degeneration.

Mesopic, dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were assessed by using fundus-controlled perimetry (``microperimetry''); and retinal microstructure was assessed by using spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence (FAF), and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer thicknesses and intensities and FAF and IR intensities were extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training data and percentage of increased mean-squared error (%IncMSE) as measurement of feature importance. RESULTS: Retinal sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic, 4.89 dB for DA cyan, and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the absence of patient-specific data. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB.

These functional tests may serve as a performance-outcome-measure (PerfO) in emerging interventional clinical trials, but utility is limited by variability and patient burden. To address these limitations, an ensemble machine-learning-based approach was evaluated to differentiate patients from controls, and predict disease categories depending on ERG ('inferred ERG') and visual impairment ('inferred visual impairment') as well as BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') based on microstructural imaging (utilizing spectral-domain optical coherence tomography) and patient data. The accuracy for 'inferred ERG' and 'inferred visual impairment' was up to 99.53 $±$ 1.02%. Prediction of BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') achieved a precision of $±$0.3LogMAR in up to 85.31% of eyes. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed that foveal status was the most important feature for BCVA prediction, while the thickness of outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor inner and outer segments as well as age of onset highly ranked for all predictions. 'Inferred ERG', 'inferred visual impairment', and 'inferred BCVA', herein, represent accurate estimates of differential functional effects of retinal microstructure, and offer quasi-functional parameters with the potential for a refined patient assessment, and investigation of potential future treatment effects or disease progression.","tags":["Stargardt disease; artificial intelligence; electroretinogram; hereditary retinal disease; optical coherence tomography; retina; visual acuity"],"title":"Prediction of function in ABCA4-related retinopathy using ensemble machine learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Henrik Terheyden","Maximilian W M Wintergerst","Carmen Pizarro","Maximilian Pfau","Gabrielle N Turski","Frank G Holz","Robert P Finger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425190,"objectID":"a0228267413e2e517c3f9934a06aa5ab","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/terheyden-2020-ko/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:49.698153Z","relpermalink":"/publication/terheyden-2020-ko/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: Hypertensive crisis causes end-organ damage through small-vessel damage as described histologically. Noninvasive optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) makes it possible to image retinal and choroidal capillaries on a microscopic level in vivo. We quantified eye vessel perfusion changes in hypertensive crisis using OCTA. Methods: Patients with hypertensive crisis (systolic blood pressure $≥$180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure $≥$110 mm Hg) and age-matched healthy controls were included in the study. OCTA en face 3 $times$ 3-mm images of the superficial and deep retinal layers and the choriocapillaris were acquired. Outcome parameters included vessel density (VD) and vessel skeleton density (VSD) of the superficial and deep retinal layers, as well as flow voids of the choriocapillaris. Results: Twenty-eight eyes of 17 patients and 31 age-matched control eyes of 18 healthy subjects were included. VD and VSD of the deep retinal layer were significantly reduced in hypertensive crisis (P $łeq$ 0.004). Choriocapillaris signal intensity was more heterogeneous in patients, and flow voids exhibited confluence with a larger average area and a lower absolute count (P $łeq$ 0.045). These changes were independent of time since onset of hypertensive crisis and of the presence and extent of retinopathy. Deep retinal changes were associated with renal end-organ failure (P = 0.045). Conclusions: Hypertensive crisis is associated with a significant reduction in retinal and choroidal capillary perfusion based on OCTA findings. These alterations are independent of retinopathy and related to end-organ damage. Translational Relevance: OCTA might help distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency earlier than currently possible.","tags":["Arterial hypertension; hypertensive crisis; optical coherence tomography angiography; perfusion; retina"],"title":"Retinal and choroidal capillary perfusion are reduced in hypertensive crisis irrespective of retinopathy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Simon Dieck","Miguel Ibarra","Ismail Moghul","Ming Wai Yeung","Jean Tori Pantel","Sarah Thiele","Maximilian Pfau","Monika Fleckenstein","Nikolas Pontikos","Peter M Krawitz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1590969600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425292,"objectID":"c03efaae9a60cb1942f1d37e0def8895","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/dieck-2020-mg/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:31.615249Z","relpermalink":"/publication/dieck-2020-mg/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Factors in color fundus photographs that can be used by humans to determine sex of individuals","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sandrine H Künzel","Philipp T Möller","Moritz Lindner","Lukas Goerdt","Jennifer Nadal","Matthias Schmid","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Frank G Holz","Monika Fleckenstein","Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425236,"objectID":"078fde012d1e4456eacbb63587d45f81","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/kunzel-2020-hj/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:35.224626Z","relpermalink":"/publication/kunzel-2020-hj/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: To longitudinally evaluate vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and define its relation to visual function and structural biomarkers.

DESIGN: Analysis of patients' data collected in the context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59 patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean ($±$standard deviation) age at baseline of 76.60$±$6.65 years and median (interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55) were included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-naı̈ve quiescent CNV (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81). METHODS: Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance images. If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying type 1 CNV. RESULTS: The prediction model achieved a high overlap between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of treatment-näve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1 CNV. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that there is markedly reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy progression.","tags":[],"title":"Type 1 choroidal neovascularization is associated with reduced localized progression of atrophy in age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kristina Hess","Maximilian Pfau","Maximilian W M Wintergerst","Karin U Loeffler","Frank G Holz","Philipp Herrmann"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1580515200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425229,"objectID":"4bd42adedee4aa08d3df4e6e1d966fcf","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/hess-2020-fb/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:28.406763Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hess-2020-fb/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: To investigate characteristics of the foveal pit and the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in patients with Alport syndrome (AS), a rare monogenetic disease due to mutations in genes encoding for collagen type IV.

A precise characterization is desirable for diagnosis and has impact on prognosis, patient counseling, and potential therapeutic options. Here, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the combination of in-depth retinal phenotyping and molecular genetic testing in complex pedigrees with different IRDs. Four affected Caucasians and two unaffected relatives were characterized including multimodal retinal imaging, functional testing, and targeted next-generation sequencing. A considerable intrafamilial phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity was identified. While the parents of the index family presented with rod-cone dystrophy and ABCA4-related retinopathy, their two sons revealed characteristics in the spectrum of incomplete congenital stationary night blindness and ocular albinism, respectively. Molecular testing revealed previously described variants in RHO, ABCA4, and MITF as well as a novel variant in CACNA1F. Identified variants were verified by intrafamilial co-segregation, bioinformatic annotations, and in silico analysis. The coexistence of four independent IRDs caused by distinct mutations and inheritance modes in one pedigree is demonstrated. These findings highlight the complexity of IRDs and underscore the need for the combination of extensive molecular genetic testing and clinical characterization. In addition, a novel variant in the CACNA1F gene is reported associated with incomplete congenital stationary night blindness.","tags":["Ngs; stargardt disease; waardenburg syndrome; congenital stationary night blindness; dystrophy; genotype; molecular testing; phenotype; retina; retinitis pigmentosa"],"title":"Comprehensive Geno- and phenotyping in a complex pedigree including four different inherited retinal dystrophies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau","Philipp L Müller","Leon von der Emde","Moritz Lindner","Philipp T Möller","Monika Fleckenstein","Frank G Holz","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425250,"objectID":"b0929b23960b3d2223312a4917588694","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2020-ph/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:49.059778Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2020-ph/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To investigate retinal sensitivity in the junctional zone of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration using patient-tailored perimetry grids for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry.

METHODS: At each annual follow-up visit, all subjects underwent ophthalmic examination with assessment of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and retinal imaging, including spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT), over a study period of 6 years. PURPOSE: To analyze longitudinal thickness changes of retinal layers in comparison with established risk factors in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) with regard to their prognostic value for conversion into advanced AMD stages. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Qualitative structural AMD features and SD-OCT-based quantitative thickness changes of different retinal layers, such as the retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex (RPEDC), were assessed by multimodal imaging. Their prognostic relevance regarding disease conversion was determined using Cox regression (cloglog link function). RESULTS: In the multivariable analysis, the presence of focal hyperpigmentation, almost reaching statistical significance, showed the strongest effect regarding the development of nonexudative late-stage AMD (hazard ratio [HR], 5.88; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.69-50.2; P = 0.052) followed by the presence of refractile drusen (HR, 4.82; 95% CI, 1.33-17.44; P = 0.0164). A thickening of the RPEDC was the only assessed retinal layer that exhibited a significant effect on the development of nonexudative advanced AMD (HR, 1.03; 95% CI, 1.0-1.07; P = 0.0393), whereas no association was observable for the other retinal layers. Neither qualitative nor quantitative markers were significant predictors for the development of exudative late-stage AMD (P  0.05).

Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in subjects with AMD (15.9 dB $±$ 2.9 dB) compared with those without AMD (17.3 dB $±$ 2.4 dB). There was no relationship between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r = -0.06; P = .32) or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an association between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39; P = .24) and drusen volume (r = -0.36; P = .30). CONCLUSIONS: In an elderly Amish population, eyes with early or intermediate AMD show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than mesopic RS, suggesting that rod function is more severely affected than cone function. Drusen area and volume measurements better correlated with scotopic RS.

While neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD. Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows considerable interindividual variability, but little is known about prognostic factors. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy lesion growth. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This pooled analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). MAIN OUTCOMES: The correlation between square root-transformed geographic atrophy growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated using linear regression. The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and follow-up times. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Slopes per allele, 95% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with geographic atrophy lesion growth. RESULTS: A total of 935 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female participants [59.0%]) were included. Two gene loci with conservative genome-wide significance were identified. Each minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15% or 0.05 mm per year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome 1; slope, 0.046 [95% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 $times$ 10-8) and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope, 0.105 [95% CI, 0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 $times$ 10-7) as the most likely progression-associated genes. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These data provide further insight into the genetic architecture of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional aspects of geographic atrophy progression and also for designing novel and targeted treatment options.","tags":[],"title":"Assessment of novel genome-wide significant gene loci and lesion growth in Geographic Atrophy secondary to age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau","Moritz Lindner","Lukas Goerdt","Sarah Thiele","Jennifer Nadal","Matthias Schmid","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Srinivas R Sadda","Frank G Holz","Monika Fleckenstein","Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study Group"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425276,"objectID":"cd4b573185a8a26342a40084f4a2bdeb","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2019-lh/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:15.335586Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2019-lh/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To systematically compare the prognostic value of multiple shape-descriptive factors in the natural course of the disease. METHODS: A total of 296 eyes of 201 patients (female patients 130; mean age: 72.2 $±$ 13.08 years) with a median follow-up of 2.38 years from 2 prospective, noninterventional natural history studies (Fundus-Autofluorescence-in-Age-related-Macular-Degeneration [clinicaltrials.gov identifier NCT00393692], Directional-Spread-in-Geographic-Atrophy [NCT02051998]) were included in the analysis. Serial fundus autofluorescence images were annotated using semiautomated image analysis software to determine the lesion area, circularity, perimeter, and caliper diameters. These variables and the fundus autofluorescence phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future square root progression rates using linear mixed-effects models. RESULTS: For the combined model, leave-one-out cross validation on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown patient) resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2: previous observation of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This indicated that shape-descriptive factors could explain 24.4% of the variance in geographic atrophy progression in previously unknown patients and 39.1% in patients with previous observation. CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the relevance of shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables, some of which are visible in optical coherence tomography.","tags":[],"title":"Prognostic value of shape-descriptive factors for the progression of geographic atrophy secondary to age-related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tjebo F C Heeren","Simone Tzaridis","Roberto Bonelli","Maximilian Pfau","Marcus Fruttiger","Mali Okada","Catherine Egan","Peter Charbel Issa","Frank G Holz"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1554076800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425219,"objectID":"68c567c79c3e26f645d42c1b33122747","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/heeren-2019-rd/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:18.243018Z","relpermalink":"/publication/heeren-2019-rd/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral neurodegenerative disorder of the central macula. Previous findings indicated more functional impairment in low light conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal dysfunction using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (``scotopic microperimetry''). Methods: Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm). Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and the results were aggregated to global indices. Results: Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a relatively higher cyan impairment. Conclusions: Rods might be compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease progression.","tags":[],"title":"Dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry in macular telangiectasia type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Moritz Lindner","Maximilian Pfau","Joanna Czauderna","Lukas Goerdt","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Frank G Holz","Monika Fleckenstein"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1551398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425208,"objectID":"032a11c6e66ff37cce48ba287fd8be5b","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/lindner-2019-zi/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:07.33226Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lindner-2019-zi/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To identify anatomic determinants of reading performance in eyes with foveal-sparing geographic atrophy (GA).

METHODS: In this cross-sectional case series, 97 eyes of 49 patients with RPE atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy underwent GAF- (518 nm excitation light) and BAF- (488 nm excitation light) imaging using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Spectralis HRA, Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and circularity. RESULTS: GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF and QDAF showed high intermodality and interreader agreement concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly higher for GAF-based grading ([95% coefficients of repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However, DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with intermodality agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Both GAF- and BAF-based quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable results with possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic excitation light.

METHODS: Seventy-seven eyes (30 eyes with macular diseases and 47 normal eyes) underwent duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour FCP (Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment, CenterVue). Non-weighted (mean defect, loss variance), variability-weighted (mean deviation, pattern standard deviation (PSD)) and graphical (cumulative defect (Bebie) curves) indices were computed. Reproducibility (coefficient of repeatability, CoR) of these indices was assessed. Cluster analysis was carried out to identify patterns of visual field deficits. RESULTS: The intrasession reproducibility was lower for the mean defect as compared with the mean deviation (CoR (dB) 2.67 vs 2.57 for mesopic, 1.71 vs 1.45 for dark-adapted cyan, 1.94 vs 1.87 for dark-adapted red testing) and lower for the square-root loss variance as compared with the PSD (CoR (dB) 1.48 vs 1.34, 0.77 vs 0.65, 1.23 vs 1.03). Hierarchical cluster analysis of the indices disclosed six patterns of visual field deficits (approximately unbiased P value0.95) with varying degrees of global versus focal defect and rod versus cone dysfunction. These were also reflected by the cumulative defect curves. CONCLUSION: FCP with mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour testing allows for reproducible assessment of different types of retinal sensitivity, whereby mean deviation and PSD exhibited the better retest reliability of the tested indices. Distinct patterns of retinal dysfunction can be identified using this setup, reflecting variable degrees of rod and cone dysfunction in different macular diseases.

Methods: Six-year longitudinal multimodal retinal imaging data (MODIAMD study) from 98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD in the study eye at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at each annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and further progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging data were compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography only. Results: Seventeen study eyes with development of central cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4%) were identified based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60%) of these eyes, presence of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color fundus photography. In six (35%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward the fovea. Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large drusen or refractile deposits were detectable before atrophy occurrence in one eye. Conclusions: The earlier and more precise detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows for more accurate detection and identification of different pathways for atrophy development. In accordance with previous clinical and histopathologic reports, the results confirm that different precursor lesions may independently proceed to central cRORA in AMD.","tags":[],"title":"Multimodal imaging patterns for development of central atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marlene Saßmannshausen","Julia S Steinberg","Rolf Fimmers","Maximilian Pfau","Sarah Thiele","Monika Fleckenstein","Frank G Holz","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425178,"objectID":"aef44050f9c31e8e47bd53dbe0c5a839","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/sasmannshausen-2018-sk/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:39:37.49245Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sasmannshausen-2018-sk/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: To examine the topographic correlation between retinal morphology and retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in eyes with intermediate AMD.

METHODS: This retrospective interventional study involved 47 DME-afflicted eyes, which were administered $≥$2 intravitreal injections of dexamethasone. Group 1 (34 eyes) received a dexamethasone monotherapy, whereas group 2 (13 eyes) received a combination therapy with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor as needed. The duration of dexamethasone effect until retreatment and the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) were defined as outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 197 injections of dexamethasone were administered in group 1 and 52 in group 2 during a mean follow-up of 23 $±$ 10 and 24 $±$ 13 months, respectively. Mean time to reinjection was 4.6 $±$ 0.5 (group 1) and 5.3 $±$ 1.0 months (group 2; P = 0.17). Reinjection intervals did not shorten over time for up to 10 dexamethasone injections per eye in group 1 and BCVA improved from before 1 month after the first implantation, 7.0 letters (P = 0.04). In group 2, there was no significant improvement in BCVA at any time point. CRT decreased from 534 $±$ 208 and 529 $±$ 215 $μ$m to 287 $±$ 115 and 371 $±$ 78 $μ$m at 3 months and increased to 460 $±$ 186 $μ$m and 547 $±$ 175 $μ$m before reinjection (groups1 and 2, respectively). The maximal CRT before each implantation remained stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: In eyes with chronic DME that respond incompletely to prior therapy or require frequent reinjections, dexamethasone shows promising long-term anatomic and functional improvement. The absence of a treatment effect reduction over time argues against a relevant rebound phenomenon.","tags":["Dme; dexamethasone intravitreal implant; diabetic macular edema; long-term treatment; pretreatment"],"title":"Long-term intravitreal dexamethasone treatment in eyes with pretreated chronic diabetic macular edema","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petra P Fang","Maximilian Pfau","Frank G Holz","Robert P Finger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1504224000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425295,"objectID":"eede67a23dbd6bf953f5cfe98330e952","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/fang-2017-if/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:34.028527Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fang-2017-if/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Persistent visual loss in dengue fever due to outer retinal damage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mayss Al-Sheikh","Khalil Ghasemi Falavarjani","Maximilian Pfau","Akihito Uji","Phillip P Le","Srinivas R Sadda"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1501545600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425245,"objectID":"ac92d14a8da1f73b78ae22fcb66a7bf7","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/al-sheikh-2017-ez/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:44.153491Z","relpermalink":"/publication/al-sheikh-2017-ez/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: To quantify vessel density (VD) and grey value (GV) as a measure of flow in the choriocapillaris (CC) in healthy subjects with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this prospective, noncomparative case series, 3 mm $times$ 3 mm OCTA images of 36 eyes of 22 healthy individuals were obtained using a swept-source instrument. VD and GV levels were calculated on CC en face slabs in the central 1-mm (subfoveal field) and surrounding 2.5-mm parafoveal ring. VD was calculated as a ratio of vessel area over nonvessel area following image binarization. GV was computed as the mean, un-normalized greyscale intensity value for all pixels in the region of interest. For each eye, the procedure was repeated 1 minute to 2 minutes later and intersession repeatability was analyzed. The choroidal thickness (CT) was automatically measured in the subfoveal and parafoveal regions and compared to VD and GV values. RESULTS: The VD ratio and GV was lower in the subfoveal field than in the parafoveal four sectors. The intersession intraclass correlation coefficients were high for both VD and GV measurements. There was no correlation observed between CT and VD or GV. CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative metrics can be obtained from CC OCTA en face images. These values show moderate to good intersession repeatability. These normative data may be of value as a reference of comparison in future studies of eyes with disease.

Results: GAF-based measurements were on average 0.062 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than BAF+NIR-based measurements and 0.077 mm (95% CI 0.06 - 0.10 mm) larger than BAF-based measurements. Interreader agreement was highest for GAF-based analysis ([CR, ICC] 0.196 mm, 0.995) followed by BAF+NIR (0.232 mm, 0.992) and BAF alone (0.263 mm, 0.991). The same was noted for the lesion perimeter and circularity. Post hoc review revealed that interreader differences were associated with media opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation to a larger extent in BAF than in GAF. Conclusions: cSLO-based GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging with semiautomated lesion delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible quantification of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF suggests that its use may be preferable in clinical trials examining the change in lesion size as a clinical endpoint.","tags":[],"title":"Green-light autofluorescence versus combined blue-light autofluorescence and near-infrared reflectance imaging in geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau","Moritz Lindner","Monika Fleckenstein","Robert P Finger","Gary S Rubin","Wolf M Harmening","Marco U Morales","Frank G Holz","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425272,"objectID":"2a5331905a6faa2688aa3411f8a82ce9","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/pfau-2017-gs/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:11.668261Z","relpermalink":"/publication/pfau-2017-gs/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of scotopic cyan and scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in normal subjects using a modified MAIA ``microperimeter'' (macular integrity assessment) device.

Methods: Treatment-naı̈ve eyes that were diagnosed with exudative AMD were prospectively examined by OCT angiography (OCT-A). The extent of the neovascular network was measured by three independent readers. Interclass-correlation coefficient and area overlap coefficients (OC) were calculated to assess locally precise agreement between measurements. As a reference for interreader agreement, the extent of the neovascular network was further measured on fluorescein angiography (FA) images. Results: A total of 31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5 years, 15 female) were included in the study. Neovascularization subtype was classified as type I in 5, type II in 11, type III in 9, and mixed in 6 eyes, respectively. Interreader agreement for measurements of the neovascular network was 0.884 for OCT-A and 0.636 for FA. Overlap coefficient was 0.705 (interquartile [IQR]: 0.450-0.76) for OCT-A and 0.704 (IQR: 0.673-0.750) for FA, respectively. Area agreement was weaker in type III and mixed lesions. Conclusions: Optical coherence tomography angiography-based measurements of the new vessel complex in neovascular AMD are feasible with interreader agreement comparable with the values obtained for FA. The results underscore the potential of OCT-A as a noninvasive diagnostic tool in neovascular AMD. Yet, further studies will be required to reveal the origin of poor agreement observed in single eyes and to advance OCT-A toward dependable use (e.g., in a reading center context).","tags":[],"title":"OCT angiography-based detection and quantification of the neovascular network in exudative AMD","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Justus G Garweg","Edoardo Baglivo","Florentina J Freiberg","Maximilian Pfau","Isabel B Pfister","Stephan Michels","Souska Zandi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1472688000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425232,"objectID":"0ca23e6161b4b950a22284573a433717","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/garweg-2016-rt/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:40:31.68638Z","relpermalink":"/publication/garweg-2016-rt/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To survey the clinical responses to treatment of chronic postoperative and uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME) with a dexamethasone-based intravitreal implant (Ozurdex(®)).

METHODS: OCT angiography was performed via an Avanti® RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy adults. A frame centered on the fovea was used for FAZ measurements. The borders of the superficial vascular layer were defined as 3 $μ$m below the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and 15 $μ$m below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the deep vascular layer as15 $μ$m and 70 $μ$m below the IPL, respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured in all eyes by two graders. RESULTS: In healthy eyes (N = 25), the FAZ surrounding vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical or horizontal oval symmetrical formation with a maximum diameter usually on the horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic eyes (N = 29) presented with disintegrity of the vascular arcades, resulting in an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer, the mean horizontal FAZ diameter was significantly larger in the DR group (753 $μ$m $±$272 $μ$m) than in the control group (573 $μ$m $±$177 $μ$m, p = 0.029). The difference was even more pronounced in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 $μ$m $±$194 $μ$m in the control group and 1009 $μ$m $±$342 $μ$m in the DR group (p = 0.001). Furthermore, in the superficial layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was 0° ($±$15°) or 90° ($±$15°) in 72.0 % of healthy eyes. In eyes with DR, the angle was 0° ($±$15°) or 90° ($±$15°) in only 6.9 % of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ. CONCLUSIONS: OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ, thus differentiating DM from healthy eyes. Vascular abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.","tags":["Diabetic retinopathy; foveal avascular zone; optical coherence tomography angiography"],"title":"Optical coherence tomography angiography of the foveal avascular zone in diabetic retinopathy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Fleckenstein","Felix Grassmann","Moritz Lindner","Maximilian Pfau","Joanna Czauderna","Tobias Strunz","Claudia von Strachwitz","Steffen Schmitz-Valckenberg","Frank G Holz","Bernhard H F Weber"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1462060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1721425271,"objectID":"2e63564f30e2d66c3ba580e1c33def55","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/publication/fleckenstein-2016-to/","publishdate":"2024-07-19T21:41:10.548145Z","relpermalink":"/publication/fleckenstein-2016-to/","section":"publication","summary":"PURPOSE: To genetically characterize a subphenotype of geographic atrophy (GA) in AMD associated with rapid progression and a diffuse-trickling appearance on fundus autofluorescence imaging.

METHODS: The presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n = 13) responding insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6 weeks or more frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and extend' regime. The injection interval, relapse-free interval, central retinal thickness, central retinal volume, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated prior to switching to aflibercept and at month 6 and year 1 after switching therapy. RESULTS: From baseline to year 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval (primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003).

Although the binary inhibitory interaction between Munc18-1 and closed syntaxin 1 is well described, the mechanism of how Munc18-1 stimulates membrane fusion remains elusive. Using a reconstituted assay that resolves vesicle docking, priming, clamping, and fusion during synaptic exocytosis, we show that helix 12 in domain 3a of Munc18-1 stimulates SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. A single point mutation (L348R) within helix 12 selectively abolishes VAMP2 binding and the stimulatory function of Munc18-1 in membrane fusion. In contrast, targeting a natural switch site (P335A) at the start of helix 12, which can result in an extended $α$-helical conformation, further accelerates lipid-mixing. Together with structural modeling, the data suggest that helix 12 provides a folding template for VAMP2, accelerating SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. Analogous SEC1/Munc18-SNARE interactions at other transport steps may provide a general mechanism to drive lipid bilayer merger. At the neuronal synapse, Munc18-1 may convert docked synaptic vesicles into a readily releasable pool.","tags":["Exocytosis; membrane fusion; membrane reconstitution; membrane trafficking; sm protein; snare proteins; synaptic vesicle; vamp2/synaptobrevin"],"title":"An extended helical conformation in domain 3a of Munc18-1 provides a template for SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
