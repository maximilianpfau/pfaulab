Einzelne, kleinere Arbeiten konnten zuvor zeigen, dass sich mittels optischer KohÃ¤renztomographie der Verlust von Photorezeptoren grob einordnen lÃ¤sst.\nInnovation: In der Arbeit, welche auf Daten einer natÃ¼rlichen Verlaufsstudie am National Eye Institute beruht (Projektleiter: Brian P. Brooks, MD, PhD), konnten wir zeigen, dass es mittels eines eigens entwickelten kÃ¼nstlichen Intelligenz-basierten Ansatz mÃ¶glich ist, prÃ¤zise den Verlust von Photorezeptoren Ã¼ber die Zeit zu erheben. Weiterhin konnten wir nachweisen, dass die unterschiedlichen Varianten im ABCA4-Gen, die alle die Stargardt-Erkrankung auslÃ¶sen, einen Einfluss auf die Krankheitsprogression haben.\nBedeutung: Die Arbeit trÃ¤gt zur Verwendung von optischer KohÃ¤renztomographie-basierten Auswertungen in laufenden und kommenden Therapiestudien bei. DarÃ¼ber werden wir in zukÃ¼nftigen Studien einzelne genetische Unterformen der Stargardt Erkrankung untersuchen.\n2. Dunkeladaptation bei altersabhÃ¤ngiger Makuladegeneration  Hess K [â€¦] Cukras CA. Evaluation of Cone- and Rod-Mediated Parameters in Dark Adaptation Testing as Outcome Measures in Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Ophthalmol Retina. 2022 May 26:S2468-6530(22)00252-4 â€“ Link\n Hintergrund: FÃ¼r die altersabhÃ¤ngige Makuladegeneration ist bereits seit einigen Jahren bekannt, dass die Dunkeladaptation â€“ beispielsweise das GewÃ¶hnen an die Dunkelheit beim Einfahren in einen Tunnel â€“ stark eingeschrÃ¤nkt ist. FÃ¼r die Bewertung der Dunkeladaptation gibt es mehrere klinische Kennzahlen, die bislang nur unzureichend verglichen wurden.\nInnovation: Diese Untersuchung â€“ der eine natÃ¼rliche Verlaufsstudie am National Eye Institute beruht (Projektleiter: Catherine A. Cukras, MD, PhD) zu Grunde liegt â€“ wies nach, dass die â€šRod-Intercept-Timeâ€˜ (Zeit, bis die Netzhaut-SensitivitÃ¤t wieder einen bestimmten Schwellenwert erreicht) sich am besten wiederholt messen lÃ¤sst und den engsten Zusammenhang mit der Krankheitsprogression zeigt. Weiterhin zeigte diese Arbeit in einer groÃŸen, longitudinalen Kohorte, dass sich eine eingeschrÃ¤nkte Funktion von Zapfen-Photorezeptoren (Zellen fÃ¼r das Tagsehen) erst im Verlauf messen lÃ¤sst.\nBedeutung: Diese VerÃ¶ffentlichung trÃ¤gt maÃŸgeblich zum VerstÃ¤ndnis der zeitlichen Abfolge des Funktionsverlust bei altersabhÃ¤ngiger Makuladegeneration ein. Das jetzt deutlich bessere VerstÃ¤ndnis zur PrÃ¤zision der Kennzahlen hilft uns dabei, zukÃ¼nftig die Krankheitsprogression genauer zu bewerten und Therapie-Studien zu planen.\n3. Therapie Effekt von Pegcetacoplan bei altersabhÃ¤ngiger Makuladegeneration  Pfau M [â€¦] Holz FG. Association of complement C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan with reduced photoreceptor degeneration beyond areas of geographic atrophy. Sci Rep. 2022 Oct 25;12(1):17870 â€“ Link\n Hintergrund: Die altersabhÃ¤ngige Makuladegeneration stellt die hÃ¤ufigste Ursache fÃ¼r einen zentralen Sehverlust dar. Bislang gibt es noch keine zugelassene Therapie. WÃ¤hrend sich bereits abzeichnete, dass das Medikament die Ausbreitung von Arealen mit schwerem Gewebeverlust (â€šgeographische Atrophieâ€˜) verlangsamt, war die Wirkung auf die restliche Netzhaut unklarer.\nInnovation: Die kÃ¼nstliche-Intelligenz-basierte Analyse, durchgefÃ¼hrt mit den Daten der internationalen Phase 2 Studie (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02503332), zeigte, dass nicht nur Areale geographischer Atrophie langsamer fortschreiten. Auch die Photorezeptor-Schichten in der umgebenden Netzhaut verdÃ¼nnen sich weniger Ã¼ber die Zeit.\nBedeutung: Die Studie legt nahe, dass Pegcetacoplan neben einem verlangsamten Fortschreiten von â€¦","date":1670765270,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670765270,"objectID":"28747db0287a52f86f49d959f1580aa3","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/post/jahr2022/","publishdate":"2022-12-11T13:27:50Z","relpermalink":"/post/jahr2022/","section":"post","summary":"Wir danken allen Freiwilligen, die dieses Jahr an einer unserer Studien teilgenommen haben.

Therefore, it might provide additional information in the advanced stages of AMD. Age-related macular degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with large differences in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition, substantial differences in some parameters occur with age, even accounting for AMD severity and RPD status. This supports the 2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and perhaps AMD pathophysiology itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the highest retest reliability, closest correlation with AMD severity and RPD, and largest longitudinal changes. This underscores the suitability of RIT as an outcome measure in clinical trials.

The optimal machine learning model predicted 16% of variability (cross-validated R2) in sCDD thresholds at 8 degrees. A novel scotopic contour deformation task can provide unique information about rod dysfunction in participants with iAMD and RPD not observed with structural and other functional assessments. Rod dysfunction observed with scotopic contour deformation testing was associated with factors linked to risk of AMD progression.","tags":null,"title":"Scotopic Contour Deformation Detection Reveals Early Rod Dysfunction in Age-Related Macular Degeneration With and Without Reticular Pseudodrusen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Pfau"],"categories":null,"content":"Projekte fÃ¼r Doktoranden Wir haben mehrere Projekte fÃ¼r Doktoranden (Dr. med.) zu vergeben.\nDer Fokus unserer Gruppe liegt auf der Entwicklung und Validierung neuer Sehfunktionstests fÃ¼r erbliche Netzhauterkrankungen und von kÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz-basierten AnsÃ¤tzen zur Struktur-Funktions-Korrelation.\nRahmenbedingungen  Vorlaufzeit: Sie sollten etwa 6 Monate vor dem angestrebten Beginn der Arbeit Kontakt mit uns aufnehmen.

This natural process also offers an opportunity to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate for presence of disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a key indicator of retinal health, which can be altered in the presence of certain diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of DA measurement and its significance to furthering our understanding of AMD has revealed essential findings underlying the pathobiology of the disease. The process of dark adaptation involves phototransduction taking place mainly between the photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer. DA occurs over a large range of luminance and is modulated by both cone and rod photoreceptors. In the photopic ranges, rods are saturated and cone cells adapt to the high luminance levels. However, under scotopic ranges, cones are unable to respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate the responses to lower levels of light as they can respond to even a single photon. Since the cone visual cycle is also based on the Muller cells, measuring the impairment in rod-based dark adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases such as AMD, which involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark adaptation parameters are metrics derived from curve-fitting dark adaptation sensitivities over time and can represent specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod break (CRB) and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly sensitive to changes in the outer retina. There is some structural and functional continuum between normal aging and the AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod intercept time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD patients with increasing disease severity determined by increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the presence of subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain morphological features in the peripheral retina. Specifications of spatial testing location, repeatability of the testing, ease and availability of the testing device in clinical settings, and test duration in elderly population are also important. We provide a detailed overview in light of all these factors.","tags":null,"title":"Dark Adaptation and Its Role in Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M. mannshausen","S.

The technique enables spatially resolved mapping of central retinal sensitivity alongside the ability to distinguish between rod and cone photoreceptor sensitivities. Two companies produce commercially available scotopic microperimeters - Nidek (Nidek Technologies Srl, Padova, Italy) and CenterVue (CenterVue S.p.A., Padova, Italy).

A recent development is the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer results of psychophysical examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging. We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in PubMed and Web of Science among others with the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)', 'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry, and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD, inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters, which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short FCP examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred retinal sensitivity, based on multimodal imaging, may be considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint for future interventional clinical trials in the future. .","tags":null,"title":"AI-based structure-function correlation in age-related macular degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["C.

SD-OCT volume scans were segmented with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal thickness and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid). Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure. In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094) using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across models. The proposed, fully automated pipeline enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in real-world settings.

The accurate spatial characterization of visual function enabled by FCP can provide insightful information about disease severity and progression not reflected by best-corrected visual acuity in a large range of disorders. This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases that initially spare the central retina in earlier disease stages. Improved intra- and inter-session retest-variability through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent key advantages of these technique. The design of disease-specific test patterns and protocols reduces the burden of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also allow for photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation of dark-adapted chromatic and photopic testing. A detailed understanding of the variety of available devices and test settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical trials. Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and technical background of FCP, its prior application in clinical and research settings, data that qualify the application of FCP as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as ongoing and future developments.","tags":null,"title":"Fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry): Application as outcome measure in clinical trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Eyes were treated with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of activity as determined by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and haemorrhages. A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients were analysed. Patients were evaluated over a mean period of 13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted the monitoring of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth) of NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular vessels was detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity occurred on OCT. NVs showed a progressive growth over time despite PRN-treatment and preferentially grew and extended within areas characterised by a focal reduction of choriocapillaris perfusion. The results indicate that OCT-A represents a useful imaging modality for monitoring NV-progression and treatment effects in MacTel. We demonstrate its advantages over conventional B-scan OCT imaging, including an earlier detection of NV-progression, and propose an adjustment of the current OCT-controlled PRN treatment regime in order to prevent NV-progression and subsequent functional loss in neovascular MacTel.","tags":null,"title":"Optical coherence tomography-angiography for monitoring neovascularisations in macular telangiectasia type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L. von der Emde","R.

As all three layers are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and relative contribution of these layers towards the development and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A, recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential protective effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis, study design, and patient assessment.","tags":null,"title":"Optical Coherence Tomography-Angiography in Geographic Atrophy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was completed March 15, 2020. Mesopic and dark-adapted 2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were performed.

Retinal function could be predicted from microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91 dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for dark-adapted red).

In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with overall dysfunction.","tags":null,"title":"Mesopic and Scotopic Light Sensitivity and Its Microstructural Correlates in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Autofluorescence imaging with blue (BAF), green (GAF), and near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF imaging obtained by an innovative confocal light-emitting diode-based retinal imaging system (Color-AF) that allows for separation of short (green emission fluorescent component) and long (red emission fluorescent component) autofluorescence emission components. Color-AF, BAF, and GAF, overall, revealed similar presentation of hyperautofluorescent flecks. Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent component matched with hyperautofluorescent flecks in NIR-AF. Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months, flecks showed a transition in the AF emission spectrum to shorter wavelengths (red emission fluorescent component to green emission fluorescent component), associated with a progressed disruption of overlaying outer retinal bands in optical coherence tomography. Newer hyperautofluorescent flecks usually revealed predominantly red emission fluorescent component. By separation of the AF spectra, the remodeling of fluorophores and associated structural changes can be monitored over time indicating a novel and susceptible surrogate marker for disease progression and potential therapeutic effects.","tags":null,"title":"SPECTRAL FUNDUS AUTOFLUORESCENCE EXCITATION AND EMISSION IN ABCA4-RELATED RETINOPATHY","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

The localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy. Odds ratio (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying type 1 CNV. ve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1 CNV. The results indicate that there is markedly reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy progression.","tags":null,"title":"Type 1 Choroidal Neovascularization Is Associated with Reduced Localized Progression of Atrophy in Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

While neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD. Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows considerable interindividual variability, but little is known about prognostic factors. To elucidate the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy lesion growth. This pooled analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated using linear regression. The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and follow-up times.

Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm). Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and the results were aggregated to global indices. Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a relatively higher cyan impairment. Rods might be compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease progression.","tags":null,"title":"Dark-Adapted Two-Color Fundus-Controlled Perimetry in Macular Telangiectasia Type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Six-year longitudinal multimodal retinal imaging data (MODIAMD study) from 98 eyes of 98 subjects with non-late-stage AMD in the study eye at baseline were analyzed for the presence of central atrophy at each annual follow-up visit. Development, manifestation, and further progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging data were compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography only. Seventeen study eyes with development of central cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4%) were identified based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60%) of these eyes, presence of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color fundus photography. In six (35%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward the fovea. Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large drusen or refractile deposits were detectable before atrophy occurrence in one eye. The earlier and more precise detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows for more accurate detection and identification of different pathways for atrophy development.

Together with structural modeling, the data suggest that helix 12 provides a folding template for VAMP2, accelerating SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. Analogous SEC1/Munc18-SNARE interactions at other transport steps may provide a general mechanism to drive lipid bilayer merger. At the neuronal synapse, Munc18-1 may convert docked synaptic vesicles into a readily releasable pool.","tags":null,"title":"An extended helical conformation in domain 3a of Munc18-1 provides a template for SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://pfaulab.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
