Photorezeptor-Verlust und Einfluss der Genetik bei Morbus Stargardt  Pfau M […] Brooks BP. Photoreceptor degeneration in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and its genetic correlates. JCI Insight. 2022 Jan 25;7(2):e155373 – Link\n Hintergrund: Die Stargardt Erkrankung stellt die häufigste erbliche Ursache für einen Verlust der Sehschärfe im erwerbstätigen Alter dar. Einzelne, kleinere Arbeiten konnten zuvor zeigen, dass sich mittels optischer Kohärenztomographie der Verlust von Photorezeptoren grob einordnen lässt.\nInnovation: In der Arbeit, welche auf Daten einer natürlichen Verlaufsstudie am National Eye Institute beruht (Projektleiter: Brian P.

Weiterhin konnten wir nachweisen, dass die unterschiedlichen Varianten im ABCA4-Gen, die alle die Stargardt-Erkrankung auslösen, einen Einfluss auf die Krankheitsprogression haben.\nBedeutung: Die Arbeit trägt zur Verwendung von optischer Kohärenztomographie-basierten Auswertungen in laufenden und kommenden Therapiestudien bei.

Evaluation of Cone- and Rod-Mediated Parameters in Dark Adaptation Testing as Outcome Measures in Age-Related Macular Degeneration. Ophthalmol Retina. 2022 May 26:S2468-6530(22)00252-4 – Link\n Hintergrund: Für die altersabhängige Makuladegeneration ist bereits seit einigen Jahren bekannt, dass die Dunkeladaptation – beispielsweise das Gewöhnen an die Dunkelheit beim Einfahren in einen Tunnel – stark eingeschränkt ist. Für die Bewertung der Dunkeladaptation gibt es mehrere klinische Kennzahlen, die bislang nur unzureichend verglichen wurden.\nInnovation: Diese Untersuchung – der eine natürliche Verlaufsstudie am National Eye Institute beruht (Projektleiter: Catherine A. Cukras, MD, PhD) zu Grunde liegt – wies nach, dass die ‚Rod-Intercept-Time‘ (Zeit, bis die Netzhaut-Sensitivität wieder einen bestimmten Schwellenwert erreicht) sich am besten wiederholt messen lässt und den engsten Zusammenhang mit der Krankheitsprogression zeigt. Weiterhin zeigte diese Arbeit in einer großen, longitudinalen Kohorte, dass sich eine eingeschränkte Funktion von Zapfen-Photorezeptoren (Zellen für das Tagsehen) erst im Verlauf messen lässt.\nBedeutung: Diese Veröffentlichung trägt maßgeblich zum Verständnis der zeitlichen Abfolge des Funktionsverlust bei altersabhängiger Makuladegeneration ein. Das jetzt deutlich bessere Verständnis zur Präzision der Kennzahlen hilft uns dabei, zukünftig die Krankheitsprogression genauer zu bewerten und Therapie-Studien zu planen.\n3.

Age-related macular degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with large differences in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition, substantial differences in some parameters occur with age, even accounting for AMD severity and RPD status. This supports the 2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and perhaps AMD pathophysiology itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the highest retest reliability, closest correlation with AMD severity and RPD, and largest longitudinal changes. This underscores the suitability of RIT as an outcome measure in clinical trials.

This natural process also offers an opportunity to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate for presence of disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a key indicator of retinal health, which can be altered in the presence of certain diseases, such as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of DA measurement and its significance to furthering our understanding of AMD has revealed essential findings underlying the pathobiology of the disease. The process of dark adaptation involves phototransduction taking place mainly between the photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer. DA occurs over a large range of luminance and is modulated by both cone and rod photoreceptors. In the photopic ranges, rods are saturated and cone cells adapt to the high luminance levels. However, under scotopic ranges, cones are unable to respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate the responses to lower levels of light as they can respond to even a single photon. Since the cone visual cycle is also based on the Muller cells, measuring the impairment in rod-based dark adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases such as AMD, which involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark adaptation parameters are metrics derived from curve-fitting dark adaptation sensitivities over time and can represent specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod break (CRB) and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly sensitive to changes in the outer retina. There is some structural and functional continuum between normal aging and the AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod intercept time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD patients with increasing disease severity determined by increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the presence of subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain morphological features in the peripheral retina. Specifications of spatial testing location, repeatability of the testing, ease and availability of the testing device in clinical settings, and test duration in elderly population are also important. We provide a detailed overview in light of all these factors.","tags":null,"title":"Dark Adaptation and Its Role in Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M. mannshausen","S.

We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in PubMed and Web of Science among others with the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)', 'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry, and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD, inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters, which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity).

Retinal thickness and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid). Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure. In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094) using NGBoost, respectively.

Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across models.

The accurate spatial characterization of visual function enabled by FCP can provide insightful information about disease severity and progression not reflected by best-corrected visual acuity in a large range of disorders. This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases that initially spare the central retina in earlier disease stages. Improved intra- and inter-session retest-variability through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent key advantages of these technique. The design of disease-specific test patterns and protocols reduces the burden of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also allow for photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation of dark-adapted chromatic and photopic testing. A detailed understanding of the variety of available devices and test settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical trials. Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and technical background of FCP, its prior application in clinical and research settings, data that qualify the application of FCP as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as ongoing and future developments.","tags":null,"title":"Fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry): Application as outcome measure in clinical trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Eyes were treated with intravitreal VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime, and treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of activity as determined by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of neovascular activity were defined as an increase in retinal thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and haemorrhages. A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients were analysed. Patients were evaluated over a mean period of 13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted the monitoring of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth) of NVs, but not neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular vessels was detectable in OCT-A before signs of activity occurred on OCT. NVs showed a progressive growth over time despite PRN-treatment and preferentially grew and extended within areas characterised by a focal reduction of choriocapillaris perfusion. The results indicate that OCT-A represents a useful imaging modality for monitoring NV-progression and treatment effects in MacTel. We demonstrate its advantages over conventional B-scan OCT imaging, including an earlier detection of NV-progression, and propose an adjustment of the current OCT-controlled PRN treatment regime in order to prevent NV-progression and subsequent functional loss in neovascular MacTel.","tags":null,"title":"Optical coherence tomography-angiography for monitoring neovascularisations in macular telangiectasia type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L. von der Emde","R.

It is characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers including photoreceptors, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and rarefication of the choriocapillaris. As all three layers are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and relative contribution of these layers towards the development and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A, recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential protective effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis, study design, and patient assessment.","tags":null,"title":"Optical Coherence Tomography-Angiography in Geographic Atrophy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was completed March 15, 2020. Mesopic and dark-adapted 2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were performed.

Retinal function could be predicted from microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91 dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor complex with sensitivity loss. In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with overall dysfunction.","tags":null,"title":"Mesopic and Scotopic Light Sensitivity and Its Microstructural Correlates in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

A total of 132 eyes of 66 patients with ABCA4-related retinopathy were investigated using multimodal AF imaging and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Autofluorescence imaging with blue (BAF), green (GAF), and near-infrared (NIR-AF) excitation wavelengths obtained by a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope was compared with AF imaging obtained by an innovative confocal light-emitting diode-based retinal imaging system (Color-AF) that allows for separation of short (green emission fluorescent component) and long (red emission fluorescent component) autofluorescence emission components. Color-AF, BAF, and GAF, overall, revealed similar presentation of hyperautofluorescent flecks. Flecks that showed predominantly red emission fluorescent component matched with hyperautofluorescent flecks in NIR-AF. Over the observation time of 5 to 14 months, flecks showed a transition in the AF emission spectrum to shorter wavelengths (red emission fluorescent component to green emission fluorescent component), associated with a progressed disruption of overlaying outer retinal bands in optical coherence tomography. Newer hyperautofluorescent flecks usually revealed predominantly red emission fluorescent component. By separation of the AF spectra, the remodeling of fluorophores and associated structural changes can be monitored over time indicating a novel and susceptible surrogate marker for disease progression and potential therapeutic effects.","tags":null,"title":"SPECTRAL FUNDUS AUTOFLUORESCENCE EXCITATION AND EMISSION IN ABCA4-RELATED RETINOPATHY","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

While neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD.

To elucidate the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy lesion growth. This pooled analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated using linear regression. The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and follow-up times.

Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm). Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and the results were aggregated to global indices. Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a relatively higher cyan impairment. Rods might be compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease progression.","tags":null,"title":"Dark-Adapted Two-Color Fundus-Controlled Perimetry in Macular Telangiectasia Type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) GAF, BAF, and NIR images of 40 eyes from 29 patients (mean age 79.7 years) with GA secondary to AMD were recorded according to a standardized protocol. GA areas were analyzed in GAF, BAF combined with NIR (BAF+NIR), or BAF alone, by four independent readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). A mixed-effects model was used to assess the effect of image modality on the measured square-root lesion area. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were assessed for the square-root lesion area, lesion perimeter, and circularity. GAF-based measurements were on average 0.062 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than BAF+NIR-based measurements and 0.077 mm (95% CI 0.06 - 0.10 mm) larger than BAF-based measurements.

The same was noted for the lesion perimeter and circularity. Post hoc review revealed that interreader differences were associated with media opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation to a larger extent in BAF than in GAF. cSLO-based GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging with semiautomated lesion delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible quantification of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF suggests that its use may be preferable in clinical trials examining the change in lesion size as a clinical endpoint.","tags":null,"title":"Green-Light Autofluorescence Versus Combined Blue-Light Autofluorescence and Near-Infrared Reflectance Imaging in Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["J.
