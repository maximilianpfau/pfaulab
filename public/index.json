Although considerable advances have been made in our understanding of AMD genetics, the differential effects of major associated loci on disease manifestation and progression may not be well characterized. To elucidate the specific associations of the 2 most common genetic risk loci for AMD, the CFH-CFHR5 locus on chromosome 1q32 (Chr1) and the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus on chromosome 10q26 (Chr10)-independent of one another and in combination-with time to conversion to late-stage disease and to visual acuity loss. 10-risk) or at either Chr1 (Chr1-risk) or Chr10 (Chr10-risk) and who had enrolled in Genetic and Molecular Studies of Eye Diseases at the Sharon Eccles Steele Center for Translational Medicine between September 2009 and March 2020. Multimodal imaging data were reviewed for AMD staging, including grading of incomplete and complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy. Hazard ratios and survival times for conversion to any late-stage AMD, atrophic or neovascular, and associated vision loss of 2 or more lines. 10-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 5.7 [2.1-11.1] years) were 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9; P = .03) times as likely and eyes in the Chr10-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 6.3 [2.7-11.3] years) were 1.8 (95% CI, 1.0-3.1; P = .05) times as likely to experience a visual acuity loss of 2 or more lines compared with eyes of the Chr1-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 9.4 [4.1-* (asterisk indicates event rate did not reach 75%)] years). These findings suggest differential associations of the 2 major AMD-related risk loci with structural and functional disease progression and suggest distinct underlying biological mechanisms associated with these 2 loci. These genotype-phenotype associations may warrant consideration when designing and interpreting AMD research studies and clinical trials.","tags":null,"title":"Progression of Age-Related Macular Degeneration Among Individuals Homozygous for Risk Alleles on Chromosome 1 (CFH-CFHR5) or Chromosome 10 (ARMS2/HTRA1) or Both","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

ML-based structure-function correlation allowed prediction of mesopic, DA cyan, and red sensitivity with high accuracy (cross-validated mean absolute error: 4.36, 7.77, and 5.31 dB, respectively), whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the absence of fundus alterations on multimodal imaging.

Patients with SFD exhibit severely impaired scotopic visual function even in the absence of funduscopic alterations on multimodal imaging. In contrast to BCVA, scotopic visual function tests are suitable to quantify dysfunction in the early stages. Improvement of scotopic dysfunction after (off-label) high-dose vitamin A intake, as observed in one patient in our study, is compatible with the hypothesized local deficiency of vitamin A secondary to Bruch's membrane alterations.","tags":null,"title":"Visual Dysfunction and Structural Correlates in Sorsby Fundus Dystrophy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Z.

We aimed to quantify ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss and photoreceptor degeneration beyond EZ-loss in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and investigate associations between photoreceptor degeneration, genotype, and age.METHODSWe analyzed 132 eyes from 66 patients (of 67 enrolled) with molecularly confirmed ABCA4-associated retinopathy from a prospective natural history study with a median [IQR] follow-up of 4.2 years [3.1, 5.1]. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (37 B-scans, 30¬∞ √ó 15¬∞) were segmented using a deep learning (DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype analysis, a model of ABCA4 variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss (6.25 mm2) as the dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an average (square-root-transformed) EZ-loss progression rate of [95% CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL thickness (to ¬±2 z score units) was 3.20¬∞ [2.53, 3.87]. Inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thinning was less pronounced, with an average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to layer thickness normalization of 1.20¬∞ [0.91, 1.48] for the IS and 0.60¬∞ [0.49, 0.72] for the OS. An additive model of allele severity explained 52.7% of variability in the age of criterion EZ-loss.CONCLUSIONPatients with ABCA4-associated retinopathy exhibited significant alterations of photoreceptors outside of EZ-loss.

Despite this, the clinical testing options for spatially resolved scotopic vision have until recently been limited. Scotopic microperimetry is a relatively new visual function test that combines two-colour perimetry with fundus-controlled perimetry performed in scotopic luminance conditions. The technique enables spatially resolved mapping of central retinal sensitivity alongside the ability to distinguish between rod and cone photoreceptor sensitivities. Two companies produce commercially available scotopic microperimeters - Nidek (Nidek Technologies Srl, Padova, Italy) and CenterVue (CenterVue S.p.A., Padova, Italy). Scotopic microperimetry is a promising technology capable of detecting changes in retinal sensitivity before changes in other measures of visual function. Scotopic microperimetry is a promising functional biomarker that has the potential as a useful clinical trial outcome measure. This review summarises the evolution and applications of scotopic microperimetry, and discusses testing options, including testing grid selection, dark-adaptation time and threshold sensitivity analyses.","tags":null,"title":"Scotopic microperimetry: evolution, applications and future directions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Emerging clinical trials require suitable end points. The characterization and validation of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is warranted. To prospectively evaluate reading performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association with established visual function assessments and structural biomarkers. The noninterventional, prospective natural history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and ended January 2021. Reading acuity and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts. Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy, followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association of those variables with reading performance. A total of 150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this study (median [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60%]; 34 men [40%]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR) monocular reading acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the reading acuity determination and a reading speed of 52.8 (0-123) words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis, best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest associations with reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity = 0.69). Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central ETDRS subfield, in the inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal analysis, a similar prediction accuracy for reading performance was determined (R2 for reading acuity = 0.73; R2 for reading speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular reading performance did not differ from reading performance in the better-seeing eye. The association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on the better-seeing eye.","tags":null,"title":"Association of Reading Performance in Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration With Visual Function and Structural Biomarkers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data from 57 eyes of 57 patients from baseline, week 6-8 and month 7-8 post-treatment were segmented using deep-learning software. Fundus-controlled perimetry data were aligned to the SD-OCT data to extract layer thickness and reflectivity values for each test point. Point-wise retinal sensitivity could be inferred with a (leave-one-out) cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) [95% CI] of 2.93 dB [2.40-3.46] (scenario 1) using random forest regression. With addition of patient-specific baseline data (scenario 2), retinal sensitivity at remaining follow-up visits was estimated even more accurately with a MAE of 1.07 dB [1.06-1.08]. In scenario 3, month 7-8 post-treatment retinal sensitivity was predicted from baseline SD-OCT data with a MAE of 3.38 dB [2.82-3.94].

A recent development is the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer results of psychophysical examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging. We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in PubMed and Web of Science among others with the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)', 'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry, and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD, inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters, which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short FCP examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred retinal sensitivity, based on multimodal imaging, may be considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint for future interventional clinical trials in the future.

To capture nonlinear progression in a flexible way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with different transformation parameters Œª. Model evaluation is performed on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective multi-center cohort studies on GA size progression.

The mean estimated age-of-onset in this model was 67.21¬±6.49 years. We provide a comprehensive framework for modeling the course of uni- or bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal observational studies.

SD-OCT volume scans were segmented with a custom deep-learning-based analysis pipeline. Retinal thickness and reflectivity values were extracted for the central and the four inner Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfields for six retinal layers (inner retina, outer nuclear layer, inner segments [IS], outer segments [OS], retinal pigment epithelium-drusen complex [RPEDC] and the choroid). Machine-learning models were probed to predict the anti-VEGF treatment frequency within the next 12 months. Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure. In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094) using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across models. The proposed, fully automated pipeline enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in real-world settings. Prediction of a probability distribution allows the physician to inspect the underlying uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty estimates are essential to highlight cases where human-inspection and/or reversion to a fallback alternative is warranted.","tags":null,"title":"Probabilistic Forecasting of Anti-VEGF Treatment Frequency in Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The accurate spatial characterization of visual function enabled by FCP can provide insightful information about disease severity and progression not reflected by best-corrected visual acuity in a large range of disorders. This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases that initially spare the central retina in earlier disease stages. Improved intra- and inter-session retest-variability through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent key advantages of these technique. The design of disease-specific test patterns and protocols reduces the burden of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also allow for photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation of dark-adapted chromatic and photopic testing. A detailed understanding of the variety of available devices and test settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical trials. Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and technical background of FCP, its prior application in clinical and research settings, data that qualify the application of FCP as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as ongoing and future developments.","tags":null,"title":"Fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry): Application as outcome measure in clinical trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L. von der Emde","R.

It is characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers including photoreceptors, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and rarefication of the choriocapillaris. As all three layers are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and relative contribution of these layers towards the development and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A, recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential protective effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis, study design, and patient assessment.","tags":null,"title":"Optical Coherence Tomography-Angiography in Geographic Atrophy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

A prospective, single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February 20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was completed March 15, 2020. Mesopic and dark-adapted 2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was performed using machine learning. Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss as measure of rod photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the accuracy of structure-function correlation. Of the 22 patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were women (68%); median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2). These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95% CI, 2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95% CI, 6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95% CI, 4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was also evident in 9 eyes with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic: estimate, 3.21 dB; 95% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted cyan: 5.93 dB; 95% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing: 4.84 dB; 95% CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal pattern of sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91 dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor complex with sensitivity loss. In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with overall dysfunction.","tags":null,"title":"Mesopic and Scotopic Light Sensitivity and Its Microstructural Correlates in Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["P.

Recent developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented precision. Which criteria must be considered for the evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology? Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization). Based on nested cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE, 95% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]). Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]). Selection of an unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.

Welche Kriterien m√ºssen f√ºr die Bewertung von Arbeiten zum Thema KI in der Augenheilkunde ber√ºcksichtigt werden? Es erfolgen die beispielhafte Vorhersage des Visus (stetige Zielgr√∂√üe) und Klassifikation von gesunden und kranken Augen (diskrete Zielgr√∂√üe) anhand von retrospektiven optischen Koh√§renztomographiebilddaten (50 Augen von 50 Patienten, 50 gesunde Augen von 50 Probanden).

Durch verschachtelte Kreuzvalidierung lie√ü sich der Visus im separaten Testdatensatz mit einem mittleren absoluten Fehler (MAE, [95 %-CI, Konfidenzintervall]) von 0,142 LogMAR [0,077; 0,207] vorhersagen. Kranke und gesunde Augen lie√üen sich im Testdatensatz mit einer Konkordanz von (Kappa nach Cohen) 0,92 klassifizieren. Die beispielhafte inkorrekte Lernalgorithmus- und Variablenauswahl resultierte in einem MAE von 0,229 LogMAR [0,150; 0,309] f√ºr den Testdatensatz.

A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59 patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean (¬±standard deviation) age at baseline of 76.60¬±6.65 years and median (interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55) were included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-na√Øve quiescent CNV (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81). Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance images. If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy. Odds ratio (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying type 1 CNV. The prediction model achieved a high overlap between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of treatment-na√Øve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1 CNV. The results indicate that there is markedly reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy progression.","tags":null,"title":"Type 1 Choroidal Neovascularization Is Associated with Reduced Localized Progression of Atrophy in Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["K.

While neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD. Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows considerable interindividual variability, but little is known about prognostic factors. To elucidate the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy lesion growth. This pooled analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE). The correlation between square root-transformed geographic atrophy growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated using linear regression. The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and follow-up times. Slopes per allele, 95% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with geographic atrophy lesion growth. A total of 935 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female participants [59.0%]) were included. Two gene loci with conservative genome-wide significance were identified. Each minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15% or 0.05 mm per year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome 1; slope, 0.046 [95% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 √ó 10-8) and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope, 0.105 [95% CI, 0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 √ó 10-7) as the most likely progression-associated genes. These data provide further insight into the genetic architecture of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional aspects of geographic atrophy progression and also for designing novel and targeted treatment options.","tags":null,"title":"Assessment of Novel Genome-Wide Significant Gene Loci and Lesion Growth in Geographic Atrophy Secondary to Age-Related Macular Degeneration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

For the combined model, leave-one-out cross validation on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown patient) resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2: previous observation of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This indicated that shape-descriptive factors could explain 24.4% of the variance in geographic atrophy progression in previously unknown patients and 39.1% in patients with previous observation. These findings confirm the relevance of shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables, some of which are visible in optical coherence tomography.","tags":null,"title":"PROGNOSTIC VALUE OF SHAPE-DESCRIPTIVE FACTORS FOR THE PROGRESSION OF GEOGRAPHIC ATROPHY SECONDARY TO AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L. von der Emde","M.

However, mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called \"microperimetry\") constitute laborious examinations. We have devised a machine-learning-based approach to predict mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) retinal sensitivity in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Extensive psychophysical testing and volumetric multimodal retinal imaging data were acquired including mesopic, DA red and DA cyan FCP, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy infrared reflectance and fundus autofluorescence imaging. With patient-wise leave-one-out cross-validation, we have been able to achieve prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 3.94 dB [3.38, 4.5] for mesopic, 4.93 dB [4.59, 5.27] for DA cyan and 4.02 dB [3.63, 4.42] for DA red testing. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data decreased the cross-validated MAE to 2.8 dB [2.51, 3.09], 3.71 dB [3.46, 3.96], and 2.85 dB [2.62, 3.08]. The most important predictive feature was outer nuclear layer thickness.

Previous findings indicated more functional impairment in low light conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal dysfunction using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (\"scotopic microperimetry\"). Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm). Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and the results were aggregated to global indices. Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a relatively higher cyan impairment. Rods might be compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease progression.","tags":null,"title":"Dark-Adapted Two-Color Fundus-Controlled Perimetry in Macular Telangiectasia Type 2","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

Monocular best-corrected visual acuity and reading acuity together with reading speed were assessed using Radner charts. Fundus autofluorescence, near-infrared reflectance, and spectral-domain OCT images were acquired using a Spectralis device. The minimal required reading rectangle (M3R), 19 letters √ó 2.4 lines in the smallest readable print size of an individual eye, was computed.

Eyes in which the M3R was nonatrophic additionally showed an increase in reading speed with decreasing print size (peak increase, +73.08 wpm [IQR, 27.43-86.64 wpm] compared with the largest test sentence). The results indicate that a defined area on the retina that can be assessed by retinal imaging is required for unhindered reading in patients with foveal-sparing GA. The findings highlight that smaller test sentences can be read faster by patients with this AMD subphenotype. Our results allow prediction of reading impairment based on imaging parameters in clinical routine and may support establishing anatomic surrogate end points in clinical trials.

OCT angiography was performed via an Avanti¬Æ RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy adults. A frame centered on the fovea was used for FAZ measurements. The borders of the superficial vascular layer were defined as 3 Œºm below the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and 15 Œºm below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the deep vascular layer as15 Œºm and 70 Œºm below the IPL, respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured in all eyes by two graders. In healthy eyes (N = 25), the FAZ surrounding vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical or horizontal oval symmetrical formation with a maximum diameter usually on the horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic eyes (N = 29) presented with disintegrity of the vascular arcades, resulting in an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer, the mean horizontal FAZ diameter was significantly larger in the DR group (753 Œºm ¬±272 Œºm) than in the control group (573 Œºm ¬±177 Œºm, p = 0.029). The difference was even more pronounced in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 Œºm ¬±194 Œºm in the control group and 1009 Œºm ¬±342 Œºm in the DR group (p = 0.001). Furthermore, in the superficial layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was 0¬∞ (¬±15¬∞) or 90¬∞ (¬±15¬∞) in 72.0 % of healthy eyes. In eyes with DR, the angle was 0¬∞ (¬±15¬∞) or 90¬∞ (¬±15¬∞) in only 6.9 % of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ. OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ, thus differentiating DM from healthy eyes. Vascular abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.","tags":null,"title":"Optical coherence tomography angiography of the foveal avascular zone in diabetic retinopathy","type":"publication"},{"authors":["M.

The presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n = 13) responding insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6 weeks or more frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and extend' regime.

From baseline to year 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval (primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003).

Although the binary inhibitory interaction between Munc18-1 and closed syntaxin 1 is well described, the mechanism of how Munc18-1 stimulates membrane fusion remains elusive. Using a reconstituted assay that resolves vesicle docking, priming, clamping, and fusion during synaptic exocytosis, we show that helix 12 in domain 3a of Munc18-1 stimulates SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. A single point mutation (L348R) within helix 12 selectively abolishes VAMP2 binding and the stimulatory function of Munc18-1 in membrane fusion. In contrast, targeting a natural switch site (P335A) at the start of helix 12, which can result in an extended Œ±-helical conformation, further accelerates lipid-mixing. Together with structural modeling, the data suggest that helix 12 provides a folding template for VAMP2, accelerating SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. Analogous SEC1/Munc18-SNARE interactions at other transport steps may provide a general mechanism to drive lipid bilayer merger. At the neuronal synapse, Munc18-1 may convert docked synaptic vesicles into a readily releasable pool.","tags":null,"title":"An extended helical conformation in domain 3a of Munc18-1 provides a template for SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) complex assembly","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://pfaulab.org/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
