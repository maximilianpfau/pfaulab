Maximilian Pfau earned his medical degree from Heidelberg University, Germany, where he also conducted basic science research in biochemistry in the laboratory of Prof. Thomas Söllner. After graduation and a research fellowship at the Doheny Eye Institute, UCLA, he completed his residency in ophthalmology at the University of Bonn under the supervision of Prof. Frank G. Holz. He subsequently pursued postdoctoral training in AI-based image analysis in Prof. Daniel Rubin’s lab at Stanford University, and in psychophysics and electrophysiology in Dr. Brett Jeffrey’s lab at the National Eye Institute.

Upon returning to Europe, he served as Senior Consultant for Inherited Retinal Diseases and Research Group Leader at the University Hospital Basel, and contributed to the development of novel therapies as Senior Principal Medical Director at Hoffmann-La Roche.
