abstract: 'Purpose: Hypertensive crisis causes end-organ damage through small-vessel
  damage as described histologically. Noninvasive optical coherence tomography angiography
  (OCTA) makes it possible to image retinal and choroidal capillaries on a microscopic
  level in vivo. We quantified eye vessel perfusion changes in hypertensive crisis
  using OCTA. Methods: Patients with hypertensive crisis (systolic blood pressure
  $≥$180 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure $≥$110 mm Hg) and age-matched healthy
  controls were included in the study. OCTA en face 3 $times$ 3-mm images of the superficial
  and deep retinal layers and the choriocapillaris were acquired. Outcome parameters
  included vessel density (VD) and vessel skeleton density (VSD) of the superficial
  and deep retinal layers, as well as flow voids of the choriocapillaris. Results:
  Twenty-eight eyes of 17 patients and 31 age-matched control eyes of 18 healthy subjects
  were included. VD and VSD of the deep retinal layer were significantly reduced in
  hypertensive crisis (P $łeq$ 0.004). Choriocapillaris signal intensity was more
  heterogeneous in patients, and flow voids exhibited confluence with a larger average
  area and a lower absolute count (P $łeq$ 0.045). These changes were independent
  of time since onset of hypertensive crisis and of the presence and extent of retinopathy.
  Deep retinal changes were associated with renal end-organ failure (P = 0.045). Conclusions:
  Hypertensive crisis is associated with a significant reduction in retinal and choroidal
  capillary perfusion based on OCTA findings. These alterations are independent of
  retinopathy and related to end-organ damage. Translational Relevance: OCTA might
  help distinguish hypertensive urgency from hypertensive emergency earlier than currently
  possible.'
