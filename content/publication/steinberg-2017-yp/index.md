abstract: 'PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the MP-1S
  (Nidek Technologies, Padova, Italy) and the S-MAIA (CenterVue, Padova, Italy) for
  mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in age-related macular degeneration
  (AMD). METHODS: Eleven eyes from 11 patients underwent mesopic and, after 30 minutes
  of dark adaptation, scotopic (MP-1S: Goldmann V, 200 ms, background luminance 0.0032
  cd/m2; S-MAIA: Goldman III, 200 ms, background luminance <0.0001 cd/m2) FCP. For
  the S-MAIA device, cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm) scotopic FCP were performed. For
  both devices, a grid of 56 stimulus points covering 16° of the central macula was
  used. Examination time, fixation stability, and threshold values were analyzed.
  RESULTS: The upper end of the dynamic range ($łeq$4 dB of lowest threshold) was
  frequently reached by the MP-1S for mesopic testing (median 34 of 56 stimuli), while
  threshold values within the lower 4 dB of the dynamic range were occasionally found
  with the S-MAIA for scotopic testing (median 3 for cyan, median 2 for red). After
  correction of the stimulus intensity for the S-MAIA results, the median difference
  for all stimuli between both devices for mesopic testing was -2.0 dB (interquartile
  range [-4;0], range -14 to 6). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that robust testing
  of mesopic and scotopic function is feasible with both devices in patients with
  AMD, although both devices are susceptible to floor and ceiling effects. TRANSLATIONAL
  RELEVANCE: The interpretation and particularly the comparison of both scotopic and
  mesopic FCP results between the MP-1S and the S-MAIA in AMD eyes need to consider
  variable susceptibility of floor and ceiling effects. Further software updates are
  desirable as FCP captures visual functional loss that is not noted with best-corrected
  central visual acuity and is important for clinical trials in AMD.'
