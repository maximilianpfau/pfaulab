abstract: "PURPOSE: After 48 months, unresolved macular edema secondary to central\
  \ retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is present in more than half of the patients treated\
  \ with ranibizumab/bevacizumab. Switching therapy to aflibercept, a more recent\
  \ vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, as well as VEGF-B and\
  \ placental growth factor inhibitor, might improve the clinical outcome in patients\
  \ with CRVO who respond insufficiently to ranibizumab/bevacizumab. METHODS: The\
  \ presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n = 13) responding\
  \ insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6\
  \ weeks or more frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to aflibercept,\
  \ which was administered based on a 'treat and extend' regime. The injection interval,\
  \ relapse-free interval, central retinal thickness, central retinal volume, visual\
  \ acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated prior to switching to aflibercept\
  \ and at month 6 and year 1 after switching therapy. RESULTS: From baseline to year\
  \ 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval (primary\
  \ end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the relapse-free interval\
  \ by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003). The mean central retinal thickness decreased by 195.84\
  \ Âµm and the mean central retinal volume (6 mm diameter) by -1.81 mm3 (p = 0.007).\
  \ Correspondingly, the mean ETDRS score increased from 66.15 at baseline to 76.54\
  \ letters at year 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept (+10.38 letters, p =\
  \ 0.021). The IOP was not statistically significantly affected (-1.2 mm Hg, p =\
  \ 0.196). CONCLUSION: Switching therapy from intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab\
  \ to aflibercept in insufficiently responding macular edema secondary to CRVO elongates\
  \ the injection interval and the relapse-free interval and provides an improved\
  \ anatomical as well as functional outcome."
