abstract: Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA)
  measures have been shown to have prognostic value for recessive Stargardt disease
  (also called ``ABCA4-related retinopathy''). These functional tests may serve as
  a performance-outcome-measure (PerfO) in emerging interventional clinical trials,
  but utility is limited by variability and patient burden. To address these limitations,
  an ensemble machine-learning-based approach was evaluated to differentiate patients
  from controls, and predict disease categories depending on ERG ('inferred ERG')
  and visual impairment ('inferred visual impairment') as well as BCVA values ('inferred
  BCVA') based on microstructural imaging (utilizing spectral-domain optical coherence
  tomography) and patient data. The accuracy for 'inferred ERG' and 'inferred visual
  impairment' was up to 99.53 $±$ 1.02%. Prediction of BCVA values ('inferred BCVA')
  achieved a precision of $±$0.3LogMAR in up to 85.31% of eyes. Analysis of the permutation
  importance revealed that foveal status was the most important feature for BCVA prediction,
  while the thickness of outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor inner and outer segments
  as well as age of onset highly ranked for all predictions. 'Inferred ERG', 'inferred
  visual impairment', and 'inferred BCVA', herein, represent accurate estimates of
  differential functional effects of retinal microstructure, and offer quasi-functional
  parameters with the potential for a refined patient assessment, and investigation
  of potential future treatment effects or disease progression.
