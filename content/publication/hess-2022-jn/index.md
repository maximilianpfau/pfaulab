abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate the suitability of 6 rod- or cone-mediated dark
  adaptation (DA) parameters as outcome measures for clinical trials in age-related
  macular degeneration (AMD), including their retest reliability, association with
  age and disease severity, and measurable longitudinal change over time. DESIGN:
  Prospective, longitudinal study (Clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01352975). PARTICIPANTS:
  A total of 191 patients with AMD and older participants followed longitudinally
  over 5 years. METHODS: Dark adaptation testing was performed using the AdaptDx dark
  adaptometer with a maximum test time of 40 minutes. A 2-part exponential-linear
  curve was fitted to obtain values for cone decay, cone plateau, time to rod-cone
  break, rod intercept time (RIT), rod adaptation rate (S2), and area under the curve.
  Intersession retest reliability was assessed in tests performed within 2 weeks using
  the Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship of DA parameters with age, AMD severity,
  and reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) presence was evaluated using linear mixed models.
  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Retest reliability, association with disease severity, and
  longitudinal change of 6 DA parameters. RESULTS: A total of 1329 DA curves were
  analyzed. Rod intercept time was the parameter that showed the greatest reliability
  (intraclass correlation coefficient of 0.88) and greatest association with age,
  AMD severity, and RPD (marginal R2 of 0.38), followed by the rod-mediated parameters
  area under the curve and rod-cone break. Cone plateau appeared constant at lower
  RIT values but increased with progressive rod dysfunction (RIT > 22.8 minutes) with
  a slope of 0.07 log units per 10 minutes RIT prolongation. Therefore, it might provide
  additional information in the advanced stages of AMD. CONCLUSIONS: Age-related macular
  degeneration severity and RPD presence are each associated with large differences
  in multiple DA curve parameters. In addition, substantial differences in some parameters
  occur with age, even accounting for AMD severity and RPD status. This supports the
  2-hit hypothesis of age and disease status on DA (and perhaps AMD pathophysiology
  itself). Of the DA parameters, RIT has the highest retest reliability, closest correlation
  with AMD severity and RPD, and largest longitudinal changes. This underscores the
  suitability of RIT as an outcome measure in clinical trials. The cone plateau increases
  only in advanced stages of kinetic rod dysfunction, indicating rod dysfunction preceding
  cone dysfunction and degeneration in the temporal sequence of pathology in AMD.'
