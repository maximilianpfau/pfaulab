abstract: "Purpose: Based on exudative activity, choroidal neovascularization (CNV)\
  \ in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) can be classified as ``active'' aCNV,\
  \ pretherapied ``silent'' sCNV (i.e., a treatment-free interval >12 weeks), or treatment-naı̈ve\
  \ ``quiescent'' qCNV. We evaluated the qualitative and quantitative optical coherence\
  \ tomography angiography (OCTA) features of these CNV subgroups. Methods: The presence\
  \ of small-caliber vessels, peripheral arcades, and a ­perilesional OCTA signal\
  \ attenuation as well as values for vessel length, density, and branching index\
  \ were evaluated for each CNV network in a 6 $times$ 6 mm OCTA scan pattern. Results:\
  \ Fifty-one eyes of 51 patients with AMD (age 75.9 $±$ 7.5 years; 20 males [39.2%])\
  \ were included. The qCNV subgroup (n = 8) showed the highest prevalence of qualitative\
  \ and quantitative values for OCTA activity criteria, reaching significance with\
  \ regard to small-caliber vessels (p = 0.003), peripheral arcades (p = 0.039), vessel\
  \ length (p = 0.020), and branching index (p < 0.001) when compared to the aCNV\
  \ (n = 32) and sCNV (n = 11) subgroups. Qualitative criteria were inversely associated\
  \ with the number of previous anti-VEGF injections (each p < 0.03), while quantitative\
  \ metrics also suggested lower values. Conclusions: These findings suggest that\
  \ OCTA may be supportive in the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions secondary\
  \ to AMD, while the assessed structural changes appeared to be more indicative of\
  \ previously administered anti-VEGF therapy than current exudative activity."
