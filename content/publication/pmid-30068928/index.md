abstract: "To examine the feasibility and utility of dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in patients with cuticular, reticular, and soft drusen, and to compare FCP data to microstructural spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data. ). Structure-function correlations were assessed using mixed-effects models. 0.001). In contrast to mesopic FCP, dark-adapted two-color FCP allowed for meaningful differential testing of rod and cone function in patients with drusen indicating predominant cone dysfunction in eyes with cuticular drusen and predominant rod dysfunction in eyes with reticular drusen. RPEDC thickness was the strongest predictor of the evaluated SD-OCT biomarkers for point-wise sensitivity."
