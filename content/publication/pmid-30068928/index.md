abstract: "To examine the feasibility and utility of dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in patients with cuticular, reticular, and soft drusen, and to compare FCP data to microstructural spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data. Forty-four eyes (24 eyes of 24 patients with drusen, age 69.4 ± 12.6 years; 20 normal eyes of 16 subjects, 61.7 ± 12.4 years) underwent duplicate mesopic, dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red FCP within 14° of the central retina (total of 12 936 threshold tests) using the Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment (S-MAIA, CenterVue, Padova, Italy) device. FCP data were registered to SD-OCT data to obtain outer nuclear layer, inner and outer photoreceptor segment, and retinal pigment epithelium drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness data spatially corresponding to the stimulus location and area (0.43°). Structure-function correlations were assessed using mixed-effects models. 0.001). In contrast to mesopic FCP, dark-adapted two-color FCP allowed for meaningful differential testing of rod and cone function in patients with drusen indicating predominant cone dysfunction in eyes with cuticular drusen and predominant rod dysfunction in eyes with reticular drusen. RPEDC thickness was the strongest predictor of the evaluated SD-OCT biomarkers for point-wise sensitivity."
