abstract: Choroideremia is an X-linked, blinding retinal degeneration with progressive
  loss of photoreceptors, retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells, and choriocapillaris.
  To study the extent to which these layers are disrupted in affected males and female
  carriers, we performed multimodal adaptive optics imaging to better visualize the
  in vivo pathogenesis of choroideremia in the living human eye. We demonstrate the
  presence of subclinical, widespread enlarged RPE cells present in all subjects imaged.
  In the fovea, the last area to be affected in choroideremia, we found greater disruption
  to the RPE than to either the photoreceptor or choriocapillaris layers. The unexpected
  finding of patches of photoreceptors that were fluorescently-labeled, but structurally
  and functionally normal, suggests that the RPE blood barrier function may be altered
  in choroideremia. Finally, we introduce a strategy for detecting enlarged cells
  using conventional ophthalmic imaging instrumentation. These findings establish
  that there is subclinical polymegathism of RPE cells in choroideremia.
