abstract: Stargardt disease (STGD1) is the most common inherited retina degeneration.
  It is caused by biallelic ABCA4 variants, and no treatment is available to date.
  STGD1 shows marked phenotypic variability, especially regarding the age of onset.
  The underlying genotype can partially explain this variability. Notably, a subset
  of ABCA4 variants was previously associated with an earlier disease onset than truncating
  ABCA4 variants, pointing toward pathogenic mechanisms beyond the loss of gene function
  in these patients. On the other end of the spectrum, variants such as p.Gly1961Glu
  were associated with markedly slower extrafoveal disease progression. Given that
  these drastic differences in phenotype are based on genotype (resulting in important
  prognostic implications for patients), this chapter reviews previous approaches
  to genotype-phenotype correlation analyses in STGD1.
