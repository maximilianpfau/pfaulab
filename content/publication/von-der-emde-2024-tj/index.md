abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Retinal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence (FAF), strongly
  depends on the clearness of the optical media. Lens status is crucial since the
  ageing lens has both light-blocking and autofluorescence (AF) properties that distort
  image analysis. Here, we report both lens opacification and AF metrics and the effect
  on automated image quality assessment. METHODS: 227 subjects (range: 19-89 years
  old) received quantitative AF of the lens (LQAF), Scheimpflug, anterior chamber
  optical coherence tomography as well as blue/green FAF (BAF/GAF), and infrared (IR)
  imaging. LQAF values, the Pentacam Nucleus Staging score and the relative lens reflectivity
  were extracted to estimate lens opacification. Mean opinion scores of FAF and IR
  image quality were compiled by medical readers. A regression model for predicting
  image quality was developed using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Correlation
  analysis was conducted to assess the association of lens scores, with retinal image
  quality derived from human or CNN annotations. RESULTS: Retinal image quality was
  generally high across all imaging modalities (IR (8.25$±$1.99) >GAF >BAF (6.6$±$3.13)).
  CNN image quality prediction was excellent (average mean absolute error (MAE) 0.9).
  Predictions were comparable to human grading. Overall, LQAF showed the highest correlation
  with image quality grading criteria for all imaging modalities (eg, Pearson correlation$±$CI
  -0.35 (-0.50 to 0.18) for BAF/LQAF). BAF image quality was most vulnerable to an
  increase in lenticular metrics, while IR (-0.19 (-0.38 to 0.01)) demonstrated the
  highest resilience. CONCLUSION: The use of CNN-based retinal image quality assessment
  achieved excellent results. The study highlights the vulnerability of BAF to lenticular
  remodelling. These results can aid in the development of cut-off values for clinical
  studies, ensuring reliable data collection for the monitoring of retinal diseases.'
