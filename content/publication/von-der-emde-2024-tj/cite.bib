 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Retinal imaging, including fundus autofluorescence
(FAF), strongly depends on the clearness of the optical media.
Lens status is crucial since the ageing lens has both
light-blocking and autofluorescence (AF) properties that distort
image analysis. Here, we report both lens opacification and AF
metrics and the effect on automated image quality assessment.
METHODS: 227 subjects (range: 19-89 years old) received
quantitative AF of the lens (LQAF), Scheimpflug, anterior
chamber optical coherence tomography as well as blue/green FAF
(BAF/GAF), and infrared (IR) imaging. LQAF values, the Pentacam
Nucleus Staging score and the relative lens reflectivity were
extracted to estimate lens opacification. Mean opinion scores of
FAF and IR image quality were compiled by medical readers. A
regression model for predicting image quality was developed
using a convolutional neural network (CNN). Correlation analysis
was conducted to assess the association of lens scores, with
retinal image quality derived from human or CNN annotations.
RESULTS: Retinal image quality was generally high across all
imaging modalities (IR (8.25$±$1.99) >GAF >BAF
(6.6$±$3.13)). CNN image quality prediction was excellent
(average mean absolute error (MAE) 0.9). Predictions were
comparable to human grading. Overall, LQAF showed the highest
correlation with image quality grading criteria for all imaging
modalities (eg, Pearson correlation$±$CI -0.35 (-0.50 to 0.18)
for BAF/LQAF). BAF image quality was most vulnerable to an
increase in lenticular metrics, while IR (-0.19 (-0.38 to 0.01))
demonstrated the highest resilience. CONCLUSION: The use of
CNN-based retinal image quality assessment achieved excellent
results. The study highlights the vulnerability of BAF to
lenticular remodelling. These results can aid in the development
of cut-off values for clinical studies, ensuring reliable data
collection for the monitoring of retinal diseases.},
