abstract: "To investigate foveal photoreceptor configuration in Alport syndrome, a rare inherited disease characterized by Collagen IV dysfunction. imaging of the foveal center and quantitative analysis of cone photoreceptor topography in a 17-year-old male patient with Alport syndrome presenting absence of a foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and foveal hypoplasia in both eyes. 2.97 in right and left eyes, respectively). Foveal hypoplasia has previously been associated with normal or reduced cone density. Our observation is the first case of disease-related supernormal cone density within the foveola, shedding light upon the role of Collagen IV in foveal maturation."
