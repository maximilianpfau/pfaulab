 abstract = {To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of scotopic cyan and scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in normal subjects using a modified MAIA "microperimeter" (macular integrity assessment) device.\\ Forty-seven normal eyes of 30 subjects (aged 33.8 years) underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505 nm), and scotopic red (627 nm) FCP, using a grid of 49 stimuli over 14Â° of the central retina. Test-retest reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation, reaction time and test duration were analyzed using mixed-effects models.\\ 0.001).\\ The modified MAIA device allows for reliable scotopic FCP in normal subjects. Our findings suggest that testing of scotopic cyan sensitivity largely reflects rod function.},
