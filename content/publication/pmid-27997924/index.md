abstract: "To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of scotopic cyan and scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in normal subjects using a modified MAIA \"microperimeter\" (macular integrity assessment) device. of the central retina. Test-retest reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation, reaction time and test duration were analyzed using mixed-effects models. 0.001). The modified MAIA device allows for reliable scotopic FCP in normal subjects. Our findings suggest that testing of scotopic cyan sensitivity largely reflects rod function."
