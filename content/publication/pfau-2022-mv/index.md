abstract: 'BACKGROUNDOutcome measures sensitive to disease progression are needed
  for ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4-associated (ABCA4-associated) retinopathy.
  We aimed to quantify ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss and photoreceptor degeneration beyond
  EZ-loss in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and investigate associations between photoreceptor
  degeneration, genotype, and age.METHODSWe analyzed 132 eyes from 66 patients (of
  67 enrolled) with molecularly confirmed ABCA4-associated retinopathy from a prospective
  natural history study with a median [IQR] follow-up of 4.2 years [3.1, 5.1]. Longitudinal
  spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (37 B-scans, 30° $times$
  15°) were segmented using a deep learning (DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype
  analysis, a model of ABCA4 variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss
  (6.25 mm2) as the dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an average (square-root-transformed)
  EZ-loss progression rate of [95% CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer
  (ONL) thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average distance from the
  EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL thickness (to $±$2 z score units) was 3.20°
  [2.53, 3.87]. Inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thinning was less pronounced,
  with an average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to layer thickness normalization
  of 1.20° [0.91, 1.48] for the IS and 0.60° [0.49, 0.72] for the OS. An additive
  model of allele severity explained 52.7% of variability in the age of criterion
  EZ-loss.CONCLUSIONPatients with ABCA4-associated retinopathy exhibited significant
  alterations of photoreceptors outside of EZ-loss. DL-based analysis of photoreceptor
  laminae may help monitor disease progression and estimate the severity of ABCA4
  variants.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01736293.FUNDINGNational
