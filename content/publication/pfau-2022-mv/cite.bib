 abstract = {BACKGROUNDOutcome measures sensitive to disease progression are
needed for ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member
4-associated (ABCA4-associated) retinopathy. We aimed to
quantify ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss and photoreceptor degeneration
beyond EZ-loss in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and investigate
associations between photoreceptor degeneration, genotype, and
age.METHODSWe analyzed 132 eyes from 66 patients (of 67
enrolled) with molecularly confirmed ABCA4-associated
retinopathy from a prospective natural history study with a
median [IQR] follow-up of 4.2 years [3.1, 5.1]. Longitudinal
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (37
B-scans, 30° $\times$ 15°) were segmented using a deep learning
(DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype analysis, a model of ABCA4
variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss (6.25
mm2) as the dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an
average (square-root-transformed) EZ-loss progression rate of
[95% CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer (ONL)
thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average
distance from the EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL
thickness (to $±$2 z score units) was 3.20° [2.53, 3.87].
Inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thinning was less
pronounced, with an average distance from the EZ-loss boundary
to layer thickness normalization of 1.20° [0.91, 1.48] for the
IS and 0.60° [0.49, 0.72] for the OS. An additive model of
allele severity explained 52.7% of variability in the age of
criterion EZ-loss.CONCLUSIONPatients with ABCA4-associated
retinopathy exhibited significant alterations of photoreceptors
outside of EZ-loss. DL-based analysis of photoreceptor laminae
may help monitor disease progression and estimate the severity
of ABCA4 variants.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov
