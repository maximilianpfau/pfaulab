abstract: "To assess the impact of distinct atrophy border characteristics based on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging on local atrophy progression. Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to AMD were recruited in the context of the Longitudinal Fundus Autofluorescence in Age-related Macular Degeneration and Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy studies (NCT00393692, NCT02051998). Horizontal and vertical SD-OCT scans were acquired at sequential visits using a device allowing for anatomically accurate registration of follow-up to baseline scans. For quantification of local atrophy progression, the lateral spread of GA (LSGA) was measured. Further, border types were independently graded. Comparison of LSGA between the different border types was performed using linear mixed-effects models. 0.001). The results indicate that SD-OCT-based assessment of local GA border morphology can serve as a predictor for local atrophy progression. These observations help to better understand the natural history and potential pathogenetic factors of GA development and progression."
