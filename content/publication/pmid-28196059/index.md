abstract: "To evaluate the reproducibility of intraretinal hard exudate (HE) quantification from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images of eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR). Cases with diabetic macular edema were enrolled. The area of HE obtained by B-scan segmentation was compared with the area obtained by en face segmentation. 0.001). Intergrader reproducibility yielded excellent agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient value of 0.99 (95% CI 0.994-0.999) for the en face approach and 0.99 (95% CI 0.977-0.997) for manual segmentation. Quantification of HE in eyes with diabetic retinopathy can be performed reliably using en face segmentation and, though the en face results are consistently lower, correlates well with HE measurements obtained by exhaustive segmentation of all B-scans in dense volume optical coherence tomography (OCT)."
