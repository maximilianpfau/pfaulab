abstract: 'PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to assess the effect of repeated injections
  of dexamethasone implants in patients with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME)
  despite prior therapies. METHODS: This retrospective interventional study involved
  47 DME-afflicted eyes, which were administered $≥$2 intravitreal injections of dexamethasone.
  Group 1 (34 eyes) received a dexamethasone monotherapy, whereas group 2 (13 eyes)
  received a combination therapy with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth
  factor as needed. The duration of dexamethasone effect until retreatment and the
  change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT)
  were defined as outcome measures. RESULTS: A total of 197 injections of dexamethasone
  were administered in group 1 and 52 in group 2 during a mean follow-up of 23 $±$
  10 and 24 $±$ 13 months, respectively. Mean time to reinjection was 4.6 $±$ 0.5
  (group 1) and 5.3 $±$ 1.0 months (group 2; P = 0.17). Reinjection intervals did
  not shorten over time for up to 10 dexamethasone injections per eye in group 1 and
  BCVA improved from before 1 month after the first implantation, 7.0 letters (P =
  0.04). In group 2, there was no significant improvement in BCVA at any time point.
  CRT decreased from 534 $±$ 208 and 529 $±$ 215 $μ$m to 287 $±$ 115 and 371 $±$ 78
  $μ$m at 3 months and increased to 460 $±$ 186 $μ$m and 547 $±$ 175 $μ$m before reinjection
  (groups1 and 2, respectively). The maximal CRT before each implantation remained
  stable over time. CONCLUSIONS: In eyes with chronic DME that respond incompletely
  to prior therapy or require frequent reinjections, dexamethasone shows promising
  long-term anatomic and functional improvement. The absence of a treatment effect
  reduction over time argues against a relevant rebound phenomenon.'
