abstract: "Purpose: To determine the effective dynamic range (EDR), retest reliability,\
  \ and number of discriminable steps (DS) for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color\
  \ fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) using the S-MAIA (Scotopic-Macular Integrity\
  \ Assessment) ``micro-perimeter.'' Methods: In this prospective cross-sectional\
  \ study, each of the 52 eyes of 52 subjects with various macular diseases (mean\
  \ age 62.0 $±$ 16.9 years; range, 19.1-90.1 years) underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic\
  \ stimuli, 400-800 nm), dark-adapted cyan (505 nm), and dark-adapted red (627 nm)\
  \ FCP using a grid of 61 stimuli covering 18° of the central retina. The EDR, the\
  \ number of DS, and the retest reliability for point-wise sensitivity (PWS) were\
  \ analyzed. The effects of fixation stability, sensitivity, and age on retest reliability\
  \ were examined using mixed-effects models. Results: The EDR was 10 to 30 dB with\
  \ five DS for mesopic and 4 to 17 dB with four DS for dark-adapted cyan and red\
  \ testing. PWS retest reliability was good among all three types of retinal sensitivity\
  \ assessments (coefficient of repeatability $±$5.79, $±$4.72, and $±$4.77 dB, respectively)\
  \ and did not depend on fixation stability or age. PWS had no effect on retest variability\
  \ in dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red testing but had a minor effect in mesopic\
  \ testing. Conclusions: Combined mesopic and dark-adapted two-color FCP allows for\
  \ reliable topographic testing of cone and rod function in patients with various\
  \ macular diseases with and without foveal fixation. Retest reliability is homogeneous\
  \ across eccentricities and various degrees of scotoma depth, including zones at\
  \ risk for disease progression. These reliability estimates can serve for the design\
  \ of future clinical trials."
