abstract: "0.05). These effects did not alter after controlling for age and sex. Best discrimination between iAMD and controls yield the combination of LLVA and contrast sensitivity as well as MAC-VA and contrast sensitivity (ROC area under the curve 0.95 and 0.93, respectively). Our results suggest that LLVA, MAC-VA, contrast sensitivity and mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry can capture visual impairment characteristic for iAMD. Best discrimination against iAMD is achieved with a combination of two tests."
