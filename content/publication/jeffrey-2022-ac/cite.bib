 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate scotopic
contour deformation detection (sCDD), and its structural
determinants, in participants with intermediate age-related
macular degeneration (iAMD) with or without reticular
pseudodrusen (RPD). Methods: Forty-one participants (aged 58-89
years), including 9 with iAMD and RPD, 16 with iAMD only, and 16
controls, underwent functional testing. The sCDD was evaluated
with radial frequency arcs presented at 4 loci: $Â±$4 degrees
and 8 degrees vertical eccentricity. Scotopic thresholds and
dark adaptation (DA) were measured at the same loci. Retinal
layers of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
volume scans were segmented. To establish the concurrent
validity of the functional test, we evaluated the fraction of
variability in sCDD thresholds explained by SD-OCT data.
Results: The iAMD group had significantly worse sCDD thresholds
compared with controls (8 degrees inferior retina: P = 0.004 and
the 4 degrees loci: P < 0.02 for both). Elevated sCDD thresholds
were observed in iAMD and RPD eyes at loci with normal scotopic
thresholds; the opposite was rarely encountered. Elevated sCDD
thresholds were also observed in iAMD eyes with normal DA.
Elevated sCDD thresholds were associated with increased age and
presence of late AMD in the fellow eye. The optimal machine
learning model predicted 16% of variability (cross-validated
R2) in sCDD thresholds at 8 degrees. Discussion: A novel
scotopic contour deformation task can provide unique information
about rod dysfunction in participants with iAMD and RPD not
observed with structural and other functional assessments. Rod
dysfunction observed with scotopic contour deformation testing
was associated with factors linked to risk of AMD progression.},
