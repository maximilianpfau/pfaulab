abstract: 'Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate scotopic contour
  deformation detection (sCDD), and its structural determinants, in participants with
  intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD) with or without reticular pseudodrusen
  (RPD). Methods: Forty-one participants (aged 58-89 years), including 9 with iAMD
  and RPD, 16 with iAMD only, and 16 controls, underwent functional testing. The sCDD
  was evaluated with radial frequency arcs presented at 4 loci: $Â±$4 degrees and 8
  degrees vertical eccentricity. Scotopic thresholds and dark adaptation (DA) were
  measured at the same loci. Retinal layers of spectral domain optical coherence tomography
  (SD-OCT) volume scans were segmented. To establish the concurrent validity of the
  functional test, we evaluated the fraction of variability in sCDD thresholds explained
  by SD-OCT data. Results: The iAMD group had significantly worse sCDD thresholds
  compared with controls (8 degrees inferior retina: P = 0.004 and the 4 degrees loci:
  P < 0.02 for both). Elevated sCDD thresholds were observed in iAMD and RPD eyes
  at loci with normal scotopic thresholds; the opposite was rarely encountered. Elevated
  sCDD thresholds were also observed in iAMD eyes with normal DA. Elevated sCDD thresholds
  were associated with increased age and presence of late AMD in the fellow eye. The
  optimal machine learning model predicted 16% of variability (cross-validated R2)
  in sCDD thresholds at 8 degrees. Discussion: A novel scotopic contour deformation
  task can provide unique information about rod dysfunction in participants with iAMD
  and RPD not observed with structural and other functional assessments. Rod dysfunction
  observed with scotopic contour deformation testing was associated with factors linked
  to risk of AMD progression.'
