abstract: 'Purpose: To examine the topographic correlation between retinal morphology
  and retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP)
  in eyes with intermediate AMD. Methods: Thirty-five eyes from 32 patients (mean
  age 70.9 years) and 29 age-matched controls prospectively underwent spectral-domain
  optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Mesopic (Goldman III, 200 ms, 4-2
  strategy) and scotopic (Goldman V, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) FCP with a 56-stimulus
  point grid was performed in AMD patients with the MP-1S. Thickness values of different
  retinal layers were measured at each stimulus point and compared, topographically
  corresponding to values in controls of similar age for pointwise structural-functional
  analysis. Results: The overall mean sensitivity in patients was 16.9 $±$ 3.0 dB
  for mesopic and 14.0 $±$ 3.7 dB for scotopic testing. Within the central 4° of the
  macula, reduced mesopic and scotopic sensitivity values were found (P < 0.0001).
  These findings correlated to central increasing retinal pigment epithelium-drusen
  complex (RPEDC) thickness and central decreasing outer nuclear layer (ONL) and photoreceptor
  (PR)-segments thickness (P < 0.0001, respectively). Structure-function correlations
  revealed that a reduction of mesopic and scotopic sensitivity was associated with
  increasing thickness of the total retina and the RPEDC and a decrease of the ONL
  and the PR-segments (P < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: Accumulation of sub-RPE
  material in patients with intermediate AMD is spatially associated to quantifiable
  structural alterations in various retinal layers and to corresponding retinal dysfunction.
  The topographic analysis of retinal thickness and retinal sensitivity will be helpful
  for a better understanding of the disease process and for the evaluation of new
  interventional approaches.'
