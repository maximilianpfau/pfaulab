abstract: "The aim of the study was to visualize and to quantify pathological foveal avascular zone (FAZ) alterations through optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in eyes with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in comparison to the unaffected fellow eyes. m below the inner plexiform layer, respectively. The length of the horizontal, vertical and maximum FAZ was manually measured for the SVL and DVL in each eye. Additionally, the angle between the maximum FAZ diameter and the papillomacular plane was measured. 0.001). OCT-A shows morphological alterations of the FAZ in eyes with CRVO and BRVO. The correlation of the maximum FAZ diameter with BCVA suggests that these alterations are functionally relevant."
