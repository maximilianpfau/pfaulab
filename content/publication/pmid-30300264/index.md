abstract: "To investigate retinal sensitivity in the junctional zone of geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration using patient-tailored perimetry grids for mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry. Twenty-five eyes with GA of 25 patients (prospective, natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study [DSGA; NCT02051998]) and 40 eyes of 40 normal subjects were included. Patient-tailored perimetry grids were generated using annotated fundus autofluorescence data. Customized software positioned test-points along iso-hulls surrounding the GA boundary at distances of 0.43°, 0.86°, 1.29°, 2.15°, and 3.01°. The grids were used for duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-color (cyan and red) fundus-controlled perimetry. Age-adjusted reference-data were obtained through regression analysis of normative data followed by spatial interpolation. 0.01). Patient-tailored fundus-controlled perimetry grids allowed for testing of retinal function in the junctional zone of GA with high spatial resolution. A distinct decrease in mesopic sensitivity loss between 0.43° (125 µm) and 1.29° (375 µm) was observed that leveled off at more distant test-points. In proximity to the GA boundary, the results indicate that rod exceeded cone dysfunction."
