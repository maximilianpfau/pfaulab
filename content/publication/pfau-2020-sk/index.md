abstract: "PURPOSE: To investigate the association between retinal microstructure\
  \ and cone and rod function in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related\
  \ macular degeneration (AMD) by using artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms. DESIGN:\
  \ Prospective, observational case series. METHODS: A total of 41 eyes of 41 patients\
  \ (75.8 $±$ 8.4 years old; 22 females) from a tertiary referral hospital were included.\
  \ Mesopic, dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red sensitivities were assessed by using fundus-controlled\
  \ perimetry (``microperimetry''); and retinal microstructure was assessed by using\
  \ spectral-domain optical-coherence-tomography (SD-OCT), fundus autofluorescence\
  \ (FAF), and near-infrared-reflectance (IR) imaging. Layer thicknesses and intensities\
  \ and FAF and IR intensities were extracted for each test point. The cross-validated\
  \ mean absolute error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of\
  \ retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training data and percentage\
  \ of increased mean-squared error (%IncMSE) as measurement of feature importance.\
  \ RESULTS: Retinal sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic,\
  \ 4.89 dB for DA cyan, and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the absence of patient-specific\
  \ data. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets\
  \ decreased the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of testing,\
  \ the outer nuclear layer thickness constituted the most important predictive feature\
  \ (35.0, 42.22, and 53.74 %IncMSE). Spatially resolved mapping of ``inferred sensitivity''\
  \ revealed regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan sensitivity\
  \ loss outside of the GA lesions. CONCLUSIONS: ``Inferred sensitivity'' accurately\
  \ reflected retinal function in patients with GA. Mapping of ``inferred sensitivity''\
  \ could facilitate monitoring of disease progression and serve as ``quasi functional''\
  \ surrogate outcome in clinical trials, especially in consideration of retinal regions\
  \ beyond areas of GA."
