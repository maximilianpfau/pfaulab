abstract: Dark adaptation (DA) refers to the slow recovery of visual sensitivity in
  darkness following exposure to intense or prolonged illumination, which bleaches
  a significant amount of the rhodopsin. This natural process also offers an opportunity
  to understand cellular function in the outer retina and evaluate for presence of
  disease. How our eyes adapt to darkness can be a key indicator of retinal health,
  which can be altered in the presence of certain diseases, such as age-related macular
  degeneration (AMD). A specific focus on clinical aspects of DA measurement and its
  significance to furthering our understanding of AMD has revealed essential findings
  underlying the pathobiology of the disease. The process of dark adaptation involves
  phototransduction taking place mainly between the photoreceptor outer segments and
  the retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer. DA occurs over a large range of luminance
  and is modulated by both cone and rod photoreceptors. In the photopic ranges, rods
  are saturated and cone cells adapt to the high luminance levels. However, under
  scotopic ranges, cones are unable to respond to the dim luminance and rods modulate
  the responses to lower levels of light as they can respond to even a single photon.
  Since the cone visual cycle is also based on the Muller cells, measuring the impairment
  in rod-based dark adaptation is thought to be particularly relevant to diseases
  such as AMD, which involves both photoreceptors and RPE. Dark adaptation parameters
  are metrics derived from curve-fitting dark adaptation sensitivities over time and
  can represent specific cellular function. Parameters such as the cone-rod break
  (CRB) and rod intercept time (RIT) are particularly sensitive to changes in the
  outer retina. There is some structural and functional continuum between normal aging
  and the AMD pathology. Many studies have shown an increase of the rod intercept
  time (RIT), i.e., delays in rod-mediated DA in AMD patients with increasing disease
  severity determined by increased drusen grade, pigment changes and the presence
  of subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and association with certain morphological
  features in the peripheral retina. Specifications of spatial testing location, repeatability
  of the testing, ease and availability of the testing device in clinical settings,
  and test duration in elderly population are also important. We provide a detailed
  overview in light of all these factors.
