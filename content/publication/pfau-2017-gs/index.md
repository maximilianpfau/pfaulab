abstract: "PURPOSE: To assess the intrasession test-retest reliability of scotopic\
  \ cyan and scotopic red fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in normal subjects using\
  \ a modified MAIA ``microperimeter'' (macular integrity assessment) device. METHODS:\
  \ Forty-seven normal eyes of 30 subjects (aged 33.8 years) underwent duplicate mesopic\
  \ (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm), scotopic cyan (505 nm), and scotopic red (627\
  \ nm) FCP, using a grid of 49 stimuli over 14° of the central retina. Test-retest\
  \ reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS), stability of fixation, reaction time\
  \ and test duration were analyzed using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: PWS test-retest\
  \ reliability was good among all 3 types of retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient\
  \ of repeatability of 4.75 dB for mesopic, 5.26 dB for scotopic cyan, and 4.06 dB\
  \ for scotopic red testing). While the mean sensitivity decreased with eccentricity\
  \ for both mesopic and scotopic red testing, it was highest at 7° eccentricity for\
  \ the scotopic cyan assessment (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The modified MAIA device\
  \ allows for reliable scotopic FCP in normal subjects. Our findings suggest that\
  \ testing of scotopic cyan sensitivity largely reflects rod function."
