 abstract = {To longitudinally evaluate vision-related quality of life (VRQoL) in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and define its relation to visual function and structural biomarkers.\\ Patients with GA secondary to AMD were recruited in the context of the prospective, non-interventional, natural-history Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy study (NCT02051998). Fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance images were semi-automatically annotated for GA. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association of putative determinants with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25) VRQoL.\\ A total of 87 patients with a mean age ± SD of 77.07 ± 7.49 years were included in the analysis. At baseline, median (IQR) best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was 0.3 (0.51) for the better eye and 0.89 (0.76) for the worse eye; 46% of the patients showed binocular and 25.3% monocular non-central GA. The VRQoL composite score was impaired: 69.96 (24.03). Sixty-six patients with a median of 2 (2) follow-up visits after 1.08 (0.78) years were examined longitudinally.\\ Vision-related quality of life is significantly impaired in patients with GA secondary to AMD. The cross-sectional and longitudinal association of VRQoL with visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of the NEI VFQ-25 VRQoL.},
