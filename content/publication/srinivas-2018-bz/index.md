abstract: 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the reproducibility of intraretinal hard exudate (HE)
  quantification from spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images
  of eyes with diabetic retinopathy (DR). METHODS: Cases with diabetic macular edema
  were enrolled. The area of HE obtained by B-scan segmentation was compared with
  the area obtained by en face segmentation. RESULTS: The mean $±$ SD for the HE area
  was 1.78 $±$ 1.37 mm with B-scan segmentation and 0.72 $±$ 0.82 mm with the automated
  en face analysis tool; the absolute difference was 1.01 $±$ 0.64 mm. There was excellent
  correlation in total HE area between the two methods (r = 0.95, P < 0.0001). The
  HE volume was 0.06 $±$ 0.07 mm. The correlation between HE volume and en face HE
  area was high (r = 0.95, P < 0.001). Intergrader reproducibility yielded excellent
  agreement with an intraclass correlation coefficient value of 0.99 (95% CI 0.994-0.999)
  for the en face approach and 0.99 (95% CI 0.977-0.997) for manual segmentation.
  CONCLUSION: Quantification of HE in eyes with diabetic retinopathy can be performed
  reliably using en face segmentation and, though the en face results are consistently
  lower, correlates well with HE measurements obtained by exhaustive segmentation
  of all B-scans in dense volume optical coherence tomography (OCT).'
