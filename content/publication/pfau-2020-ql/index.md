abstract: "BACKGROUND: Empirical models have been an integral part of everyday clinical\
  \ practice in ophthalmology since the introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff\
  \ (SRK) formula. Recent developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial\
  \ intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide range of ophthalmological\
  \ questions with an unprecedented precision. OBJECTIVE: Which criteria must be considered\
  \ for the evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology? MATERIAL AND METHODS:\
  \ Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous outcome) and classification\
  \ of healthy and diseased eyes (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled\
  \ optical coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy eyes of\
  \ 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested cross-validation (for learning\
  \ algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization). RESULTS: Based on nested\
  \ cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted in the separate\
  \ test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE, 95% confidence interval, CI of\
  \ 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]). Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified\
  \ in the test data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The exemplary\
  \ incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection resulted in an MAE for visual\
  \ acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic\
  \ overfitting became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE (0.235\
  \ LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]). CONCLUSION: Selection of an unsuitable measure of the\
  \ goodness-of-fit, inadequate validation, or withholding of a null or reference\
  \ model can obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated pitfalls\
  \ can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings."
