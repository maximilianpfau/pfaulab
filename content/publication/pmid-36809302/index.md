abstract: "To quantify choriocapillaris flow alterations in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) in pre-atrophic stages and its association with structural changes of the choroid and outer retina. 6-mm optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images were analyzed for thicknesses of the choroid and outer retinal microstructure and correlated with choriocapillaris FDs in the respective Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study subfield. 0.001). Patients with PXE display significant alterations of the choriocapillaris on OCTA even in pre-atrophic stages and in the absence of significant choroidal thinning. The analysis favors choriocapillaris FDs over choroidal thickness as a potential early outcome measure for future interventional trials in PXE. Further, increased FDs in nasal compared to temporal locations mirror the centrifugal spread of Bruch's membrane calcification in PXE."
