abstract: "To assess the longitudinal association between outer retinal microstructure and mesopic as well as scotopic retinal sensitivity in patients with drusen secondary to intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). Prospective, longitudinal natural history study. 125 μm) associated with iAMD and 27 age-matched healthy control eyes. Participants underwent spectral-domain OCT and both mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP). Annual follow-up visits were performed over a 3-year period. Pointwise correlation of retinal sensitivity stimuli to corresponding standardized (Z score) pointwise retinal thickness. Linear mixed-effect models were applied to analyze longitudinally the association of pointwise retinal thickness changes, follow-up time, or both with retinal function. 0.001). The longitudinal structure-function correlation demonstrated a progressive quantifiable degeneration of the outer retina in iAMD associated with photoreceptor dysfunction. Because longitudinal sensitivity changes could not be explained by structural changes alone, an unmet need remains for additional refined parameters on retinal structure to predict retinal function."
