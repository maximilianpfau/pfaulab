abstract: 'PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the functional impact of
  oral vitamin A supplementation in patients with intermediate age-related macular
  degeneration with and without reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) demonstrating dysfunction
  in dark adaptation. METHODS: Five patients with intermediate age-related macular
  degeneration and without RPD (AMD group; mean $±$ SD age 78.0 $±$ 4.7 years) and
  seven with RPD (RPD group; age 74.1 $±$ 11.2 years) were supplemented with 16,000
  IU of vitamin A palmitate for 8 weeks. Assessment at baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks
  included scotopic thresholds, dark adaptation, best-corrected and low luminance
  visual acuities, and the low-luminance quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: In
  the linear mixed model, rod intercept time improved significantly in the AMD group
  (mean [95% CI] change -1.1 minutes [-1.8; -0.5] after 4 weeks ( P < 0.001) and -2.2
  min [-2.9 to -1.6] after 8 weeks of vitamin A supplementation ( P < 0.001). The
  dark adaptation cone plateau also significantly improved (i.e., more sensitive cone
  threshold) at 4 and 8 weeks ( P = 0.026 and P = 0.001). No other parameters improved
  in the AMD group, and there was no significant improvement in any parameter in the
  RPD group despite significantly elevated serum vitamin A levels measurable in both
  groups after supplementation ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.013). CONCLUSION: Supplementation
  with 16,000 IU vitamin A, a lower dose than used in previous studies, partially
  overcomes the pathophysiologic functional changes in AMD eyes. The lack of improvement
  in the RPD group may indicate structural impediments to increasing vitamin A availability
  in these patients and/or may reflect the higher variability observed in the functional
  parameters for this group.'
