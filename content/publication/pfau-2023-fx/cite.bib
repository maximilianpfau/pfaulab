 abstract = {PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine the functional
impact of oral vitamin A supplementation in patients with
intermediate age-related macular degeneration with and without
reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) demonstrating dysfunction in dark
adaptation. METHODS: Five patients with intermediate age-related
macular degeneration and without RPD (AMD group; mean $±$ SD
age 78.0 $±$ 4.7 years) and seven with RPD (RPD group; age
74.1 $±$ 11.2 years) were supplemented with 16,000 IU of
vitamin A palmitate for 8 weeks. Assessment at baseline, 4, 8,
and 12 weeks included scotopic thresholds, dark adaptation,
best-corrected and low luminance visual acuities, and the
low-luminance quality of life questionnaire. RESULTS: In the
linear mixed model, rod intercept time improved significantly in
the AMD group (mean [95% CI] change -1.1 minutes [-1.8; -0.5]
after 4 weeks ( P < 0.001) and -2.2 min [-2.9 to -1.6] after 8
weeks of vitamin A supplementation ( P < 0.001). The dark
adaptation cone plateau also significantly improved (i.e., more
sensitive cone threshold) at 4 and 8 weeks ( P = 0.026 and P =
0.001). No other parameters improved in the AMD group, and there
was no significant improvement in any parameter in the RPD group
despite significantly elevated serum vitamin A levels measurable
in both groups after supplementation ( P = 0.024 and P = 0.013).
CONCLUSION: Supplementation with 16,000 IU vitamin A, a lower
dose than used in previous studies, partially overcomes the
pathophysiologic functional changes in AMD eyes. The lack of
improvement in the RPD group may indicate structural impediments
to increasing vitamin A availability in these patients and/or
may reflect the higher variability observed in the functional
parameters for this group.},
