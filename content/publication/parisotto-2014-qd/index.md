abstract: Munc18-1, a SEC1/Munc18 protein and key regulatory protein in synaptic transmission,
  can either promote or inhibit SNARE complex assembly. Although the binary inhibitory
  interaction between Munc18-1 and closed syntaxin 1 is well described, the mechanism
  of how Munc18-1 stimulates membrane fusion remains elusive. Using a reconstituted
  assay that resolves vesicle docking, priming, clamping, and fusion during synaptic
  exocytosis, we show that helix 12 in domain 3a of Munc18-1 stimulates SNAREpin assembly
  and membrane fusion. A single point mutation (L348R) within helix 12 selectively
  abolishes VAMP2 binding and the stimulatory function of Munc18-1 in membrane fusion.
  In contrast, targeting a natural switch site (P335A) at the start of helix 12, which
  can result in an extended $α$-helical conformation, further accelerates lipid-mixing.
  Together with structural modeling, the data suggest that helix 12 provides a folding
  template for VAMP2, accelerating SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. Analogous
  SEC1/Munc18-SNARE interactions at other transport steps may provide a general mechanism
  to drive lipid bilayer merger. At the neuronal synapse, Munc18-1 may convert docked
  synaptic vesicles into a readily releasable pool.
