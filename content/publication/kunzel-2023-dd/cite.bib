 abstract = {Background/Aims: The primary objective was to determine how
structural and functional parameters influence the vision-related
quality of life (VRQoL) in patients with geographic atrophy (GA)
secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Methods:
This prospective, non-interventional, natural-history
'Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy' study was conducted at
the University Eye Hospital in Bonn, enrolling 82 patients with
bilateral GA. Parameters such as GA location (assessed by the
Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid), best-corrected
visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading
acuity, and speed were examined. The association between these
parameters and VRQoL, as gauged using the National Eye Institute
Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25), was analyzed
through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with
linear mixed-effects models. Results: The average total GA area
observed was 2.9 $±$ 1.2 mm2 (better eye) and 3.1 $±$ 1.3 mm2
(worse eye). The VRQoL scores for distance and near activities
were most associated with the inner lower and inner left
subfields of the better eye. For foveal-sparing patients, the
LLVA of the better eye was the predominant determinate impacting
all VRQoL scales. Conclusion: GA location, specifically the inner
lower and inner left subfields of the better eye, has a notable
effect on VRQoL in GA patients. LLVA stands out as especially
vital in foveal-sparing patients, underscoring the importance for
clinicians to incorporate considerations of GA location and
functional parameters into their risk-benefit assessments for
emerging treatments.},
