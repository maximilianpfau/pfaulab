abstract: "Background/Aims: The primary objective was to determine how structural\
  \ and functional parameters influence the vision-related quality of life (VRQoL)\
  \ in patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration\
  \ (AMD). Methods: This prospective, non-interventional, natural-history 'Directional\
  \ Spread in Geographic-Atrophy' study was conducted at the University Eye Hospital\
  \ in Bonn, enrolling 82 patients with bilateral GA. Parameters such as GA location\
  \ (assessed by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid), best-corrected\
  \ visual acuity (BCVA), low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and\
  \ speed were examined. The association between these parameters and VRQoL, as gauged\
  \ using the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25 (NEI VFQ-25),\
  \ was analyzed through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with linear\
  \ mixed-effects models. Results: The average total GA area observed was 2.9 $±$\
  \ 1.2 mm2 (better eye) and 3.1 $±$ 1.3 mm2 (worse eye). The VRQoL scores for distance\
  \ and near activities were most associated with the inner lower and inner left subfields\
  \ of the better eye. For foveal-sparing patients, the LLVA of the better eye was\
  \ the predominant determinate impacting all VRQoL scales. Conclusion: GA location,\
  \ specifically the inner lower and inner left subfields of the better eye, has a\
  \ notable effect on VRQoL in GA patients. LLVA stands out as especially vital in\
  \ foveal-sparing patients, underscoring the importance for clinicians to incorporate\
  \ considerations of GA location and functional parameters into their risk-benefit\
  \ assessments for emerging treatments."
