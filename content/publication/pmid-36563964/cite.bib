 abstract = {To report the prevalence and topographic distribution of structural characteristics in study participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and controls in the cross-sectional study part of the MACUSTAR study (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03349801).\\ European, multicenter cohort study.\\ = 56).\\ In study eyes with intermediate AMD (iAMD), the presence of structural AMD biomarkers, including pigmentary abnormalities (PAs), pigment epithelium detachment (PED), refractile deposits, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), hyperreflective foci (HRF), incomplete/complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and outer retinal atrophy (i/cRORA), and quiescent choroidal neovascularization (qCNV) was systematically determined in the prospectively acquired multimodal retinal imaging cross-sectional data set of MACUSTAR. Retinal layer thicknesses and the RPE drusen complex (RPEDC) volume were determined for the total study cohort in spectral-domain (SD) OCT imaging using a deep-learning-based algorithm.\\ Prevalence and topographic distribution of structural iAMD features.\\ was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial analysis demonstrated a predominant distribution of RPD in the superior and temporal subfields at a foveal eccentricity of 1.5 to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct topographic distribution involving the foveal center.\\ Detailed knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD biomarkers is vital to identify reliable outcome measure for disease progression. Longitudinal analyses are needed to evaluate their prognostic value for conversion to advanced disease stages.\\ Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references.},
