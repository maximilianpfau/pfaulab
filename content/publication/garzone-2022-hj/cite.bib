 abstract = {Drusen are hallmarks of early and intermediate age-related
macular degeneration (AMD) but their quantification remains a
challenge. We compared automated drusen volume measurements
between different OCT devices. We included 380 eyes from 200
individuals with bilateral intermediate (iAMD, n = 126), early
(eAMD, n = 25) or no AMD (n = 49) from the MACUSTAR study. We
assessed OCT scans from Cirrus (200 $\times$ 200 macular cube, 6
$\times$ 6 mm; Zeiss Meditec, CA) and Spectralis (20° $\times$
20°, 25 B-scans; 30° $\times$ 25°, 241 B-scans; Heidelberg
Engineering, Germany) devices. Sensitivity and specificity for
drusen detection and differences between modalities were
assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and
mean difference in a 5 mm diameter fovea-centered circle.
Specificity was > 90% in the three modalities. In eAMD, we
observed highest sensitivity in the denser Spectralis scan
(68.1). The two different Spectralis modalities showed a
significantly higher agreement in quantifying drusen volume in
iAMD (ICC 0.993 [0.991-0.994]) than the dense Spectralis with
Cirrus scan (ICC 0.807 [0.757-0.847]). Formulae for drusen
volume conversion in iAMD between the two devices are provided.
Automated drusen volume measures are not interchangeable between
devices and softwares and need to be interpreted with the used
imaging devices and software in mind. Accounting for systematic
difference between methods increases comparability and
conversion formulae are provided. Less dense scans did not
affect drusen volume measurements in iAMD but decreased
sensitivity for medium drusen in eAMD.Trial registration:
