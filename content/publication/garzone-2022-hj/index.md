abstract: 'Drusen are hallmarks of early and intermediate age-related macular degeneration
  (AMD) but their quantification remains a challenge. We compared automated drusen
  volume measurements between different OCT devices. We included 380 eyes from 200
  individuals with bilateral intermediate (iAMD, n = 126), early (eAMD, n = 25) or
  no AMD (n = 49) from the MACUSTAR study. We assessed OCT scans from Cirrus (200
  $times$ 200 macular cube, 6 $times$ 6 mm; Zeiss Meditec, CA) and Spectralis (20°
  $times$ 20°, 25 B-scans; 30° $times$ 25°, 241 B-scans; Heidelberg Engineering, Germany)
  devices. Sensitivity and specificity for drusen detection and differences between
  modalities were assessed with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICCs) and mean
  difference in a 5 mm diameter fovea-centered circle. Specificity was > 90% in the
  three modalities. In eAMD, we observed highest sensitivity in the denser Spectralis
  scan (68.1). The two different Spectralis modalities showed a significantly higher
  agreement in quantifying drusen volume in iAMD (ICC 0.993 [0.991-0.994]) than the
  dense Spectralis with Cirrus scan (ICC 0.807 [0.757-0.847]). Formulae for drusen
  volume conversion in iAMD between the two devices are provided. Automated drusen
  volume measures are not interchangeable between devices and softwares and need to
  be interpreted with the used imaging devices and software in mind. Accounting for
  systematic difference between methods increases comparability and conversion formulae
  are provided. Less dense scans did not affect drusen volume measurements in iAMD
  but decreased sensitivity for medium drusen in eAMD.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov
  NCT03349801. Registered on 22 November 2017.'
