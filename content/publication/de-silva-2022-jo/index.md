abstract: 'Purpose: This study investigates deep-learning (DL) sequence modeling techniques
  to reliably fit dark adaptation (DA) curves and estimate their key parameters in
  patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to improve robustness and curve
  predictions. Methods: A long-short-term memory autoencoder was used as the DL method
  to model the DA curve. The performance was compared against the classical nonlinear
  regression method using goodness-of-fit and repeatability metrics. Experiments were
  performed to predict the latter portion of the curve using data from early measurements.
  The prediction accuracy was quantified as the rod intercept time (RIT) prediction
  error between predicted and actual curves. Results: The two models had comparable
  goodness-of-fit measures, with root mean squared error (RMSE; SD) = 0.11 (0.04)
  log-units (LU) for the classical model and RMSE = 0.13 (0.06) LU for the DL model.
  Repeatability of the curve fits evaluated after introduction of random perturbations,
  and after performing repeated testing, demonstrated superiority of the DL method,
  especially among parameters related to cone decay. The DL method exhibited superior
  ability to predict the curve and RIT using points prior to -2 LU, with 3.1 $±$ 3.1
  minutes RIT prediction error, compared to 19.1 $±$ 18.6 minutes RIT error for the
  classical method. Conclusions: The parameters obtained from the DL method demonstrated
  superior robustness as well as predictability of the curve. These could provide
  important advances in using multiple DA curve parameters to characterize AMD severity.
  Translational Relevance: Dark adaptation is an important functional measure in studies
  of AMD and curve modeling using DL methods can lead to improved clinical trial end
  points.'
