abstract: 'Importance: Correlates for Bruch membrane alterations are needed for interventional
  trials targeting the Bruch membrane in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). Objectives:
  To quantify mesopic and scotopic light sensitivity and identify its microstructural
  correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane in patients with PXE. Design,
  Setting, and Participants: A prospective, single-center, cross-sectional case-control
  study was conducted at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February
  20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals
  were included. Data analysis was completed March 15, 2020. Exposures: Mesopic and
  dark-adapted 2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal
  retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT)
  and OCT angiography were performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed
  models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was performed using
  machine learning. Main Outcomes and Measures: Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity
  loss as measure of rod photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error
  between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the accuracy of structure-function
  correlation. Results: Of the 22 patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were
  women (68%); median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2). These patients
  exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95% CI, 2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate,
  9.08 dB; 95% CI, 6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95% CI,
  4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was also evident in 9 eyes
  with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic: estimate, 3.21 dB; 95% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted
  cyan: 5.93 dB; 95% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing: 4.84 dB; 95%
  CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal pattern of sensitivity loss with
  preserved function toward the periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from
  microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91 dB for mesopic,
  5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based
  analysis highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and putative separation
  of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor complex with sensitivity loss. Conclusions
  and Relevance: In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without
  choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being most
  pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics
  of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor degeneration
  and/or dysfunction. A putative pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further
  impair rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with
  overall dysfunction.'
