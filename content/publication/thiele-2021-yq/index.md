abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To characterise early stages of geographic atrophy (GA) development
  in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and to determine the prognostic value
  of structural precursor lesions in eyes with intermediate (i) AMD on the subsequent
  GA progression. METHODS: Structural precursor lesions for atrophic areas (lesion
  size at least 0.5 mm² in fundus autofluorescence images) were retrospectively identified
  based on multimodal imaging and evaluated for association with the subsequent GA
  enlargement rates (square-root transformed, sqrt). A linear mixed-effects model
  was used to account for the hierarchical nature of the data with a Tukey post hoc
  test to assess the impact of the local precursor on the subsequent GA progression
  rate. RESULTS: A total of 39 eyes with GA of 34 patients with a mean age of 74.4$±$6.7
  ($±$SD) years were included in this study. Five precursor lesions (phenotypes 1-5)
  preceding GA development were identified: large, sub-retinal pigment epithelial
  drusen (n=19), reticular pseudodrusen (RPD, n=10), refractile deposits (n=4), pigment
  epithelial detachment (n=4) and vitelliform lesions (n=2). Precursor lesions exhibited
  a significant association with the subsequent (sqrt) GA progression rates (p=0.0018)
  with RPD (phenotype 2) being associated with the fastest GA enlargement (2.29$±$0.52
  ($±$SE) mm/year. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate the prognostic relevance of iAMD
  phenotyping for subsequent GA progression highlighting the role of structural AMD
  features across different AMD stages.'
