abstract: Geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration is
  among the most common causes of irreversible vision loss in industrialized countries.
  Recently, two therapies have been approved by the US FDA. However, given the nature
  of their treatment effect, which primarily involves a relative decrease in disease
  progression, discerning the individual treatment response at the individual level
  may not be readily apparent. Thus, clinical decision-making may have to rely on
  the quantification of the slope of GA progression before and during treatment. A
  panel of imaging modalities and artificial intelligence (AI)-based algorithms are
  available for such quantifications. This article aims to provide a comprehensive
  overview of the fundamentals of GA imaging, the procedures for diagnosis and classification
  using these images, and the cutting-edge role of AI algorithms in automatically
  deriving diagnostic and prognostic insights from imaging data.
