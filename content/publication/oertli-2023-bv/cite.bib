 abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to establish and validate
a novel fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry method. Methods: We
developed a custom dark-adaptometry software for the S-MAIA
device using the open-perimetry-interface. In the
validation-substudy, participants underwent dark-adaptometry
testing with a comparator device (MonCvONE, 59% rhodopsin
bleach, cyan and red stimuli centered at 2 degrees, 4 degrees,
and 6 degrees eccentricity). Following a brief break
(approximately 5 minutes), the participants were bleached again
and underwent dark-adaptometry testing with the S-MAIA device
(same loci). In the retest reliability-substudy, participants
were tested twice with the S-MAIA device (same loci as above).
Nonlinear curve fitting was applied to extract dark-adaptation
curve parameters. Validity and repeatability were summarized in
terms of the mean bias and 95% limits of agreement (LoAs).
Results: In the validation-substudy (N = 20 participants, median
age interquartile range [IQR] 31.5 years [IQR = 25.8, 62.0]),
measures of rod-mediated dark-adaptation showed little to no
between method differences for the cone-rod-break-time (bias 95%
confidence interval [95% CI] of +0.1 minutes [95% CI = -0.6 to
0.8]), rod-intercept-time (-0.23 minutes [95% CI = -1.38 to
0.93]), and S2 slope (-0.01 LogUnits/minutes [95% CI = -0.02 to
-0.01]). In the retest reliability-substudy (N = 10 participants,
32.0 years [95% CI = 27.0, 57.5]), the corresponding LoAs were
(cone-rod-break-time) -3.94 to 2.78 minutes, (rod-intercept-time)
-4.55 to 3.11 minutes, and (S2 slope [rate-limited component of
rod recovery]) -0.03 to 0.03 LogUnits/minutes. The LoAs for the
steady-state cone and rod thresholds were -0.28 to 0.33 LogUnits
and -0.34 to 0.28 LogUnits. Conclusions: The devised
fundus-controlled dark-adaptometry method yields valid and
reliable results. Translational Relevance: Fundus-controlled
dark-adaptometry solves the critical need for localized testing
of the visual cycle and retinoid transfer in eyes with unstable
fixation.},
