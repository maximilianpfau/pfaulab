abstract: 'AIMS: To identify morphological characteristics preceding the development
  of exudative neovascularisation secondary to Macular Telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel)
  using multimodal retinal imaging. METHODS: In this retrospective study, eyes with
  a minimum observation period of 6 months prior to the de novo diagnosis of an exudative
  neovascularisation secondary to MacTel were analysed. Morphological changes preceding
  the formation of neovascularisation were evaluated using colour fundus photography,
  infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular pigment measurement and optical
  coherence tomography (OCT). OCT-angiography (OCT-A) images were additionally available
  in a subset of patients. RESULTS: Twenty eyes from 20 patients were examined over
  a median period of 17 months (range: 6-100 months). Eyes were characterised by an
  accelerated progression of ellipsoid zone loss (median of 0.013 mm2/month), increased
  thickness of the temporal parafovea and hyper-reflective lesions on OCT. The latter
  underwent morphological changes preceding the development of exudative neovascularisation,
  including an increase in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal layers
  and the retinal pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a foveal depletion of macular
  pigment. On OCT-A, a focal increase in blood flow was observed at the level of the
  outer retina/choriocapillaris, and retinal-retinal and retinal-choroidal anastomoses
  preceded the formation of exudative neovascularisation. CONCLUSIONS: Multimodal
  imaging allows the identification of prognostic morphological features preceding
  the formation of exudative neovascularisation in MacTel. Eyes exhibiting these characteristics
  should be monitored closely and patients should be alert for emergent symptoms in
  order to detect and treat neovascularisation early and, thereby, prevent irreversible
  visual loss.'
