abstract: 'PURPOSE: To describe imaging features of Macular Telangiectasia Type 2
  (MacTel) eyes experiencing ellipsoid zone (EZ) recovery. METHODS: MacTel patients
  with EZ-recovery were identified from the Natural History and Observational Registry
  Study and underwent retinal imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT)
  and fundus photography. Eyes were graded according to the classification system
  by Gass and Blodi, the EZ-loss area was measured and OCT parameters were assessed
  by two independent readers. Parameters were analysed for their presence prior to
  EZ-recovery. RESULTS: Twenty-four eyes of 21 patients (12 female, 57.12%; mean age
  68 $±$ 8.54 years) were included in this study and followed for 21.25 $±$ 12.79
  months. At baseline, mean EZ-loss area was 0.036 $±$ 0.028 mm2 and 0.01 $±$ 0.013
  mm2 at follow-up (p<0.001). A persisting external limiting membrane overlaying the
  EZ-loss was detected in 16 cases (66%) and hyperreflective changes in the outer
  retina were present in 18 cases (75%). Best corrected visual acuity was 0.23 (20/32)
  $±$ 0.33 logMar at baseline and 0.34 (20/40) $±$ 0.34 logMar at follow up (p=0.3).
  CONCLUSION: Distinct OCT features precede ellipsoid zone recovery in MacTel and
  warrant further studies investigating implications for patient care and clinical
  trial interpretation.'
