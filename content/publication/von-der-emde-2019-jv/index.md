abstract: "PURPOSE: To determine the retest variability of mesopic and two-color dark-adapted\
  \ (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP), to evaluate the predictive value of patient\
  \ reliability indices, and to analyze the extent of impairment of rod- and cone\
  \ function in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). METHODS: A total\
  \ of 50 eyes of 50 patients with nAMD (mean age, 76.1 years) and 70 eyes of 70 age-similar\
  \ normal subjects underwent multimodal imaging as well as mesopic and DA two-color\
  \ perimetry using the S-MAIA device. A subset of patients (n = 28) underwent duplicate\
  \ testing for retest reliability assessment. Mixed models were used for analysis\
  \ of the hierarchical data. RESULTS: In eyes with nAMD, the coefficient of repeatability\
  \ was (mean $±$ standard deviation [SD]) 5.99 $±$ 1.55 dB for mesopic, 6.14 $±$\
  \ 2.19 dB for DA cyan, and 6.06 $±$ 1.09 dB for DA red testing. ``Patient reliability\
  \ indices'' explained 55%, 54.2%, and 64.2% of the variance in retest variability.\
  \ The mean sensitivity loss was greater for DA cyan compared to DA red testing (cyan-red\
  \ differences [mean $±$ SD] -2.63 $±$ 3.87 dB, P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The relatively\
  \ greater degree of DA cyan versus DA red sensitivity loss indicates preferential\
  \ rod vulnerability in nAMD, and qualifies rod function-based outcomes measures\
  \ as potential sensitive and early markers of treatment response in nAMD. TRANSLATIONAL\
  \ RELEVANCE: The S-MAIA allows reliable testing of mesopic, DA cyan, and DA red\
  \ sensitivity in patients with nAMD. Patient reliability indices may serve as eligibility\
  \ criteria for clinical trials to identify patients with adequate retest reliability."
