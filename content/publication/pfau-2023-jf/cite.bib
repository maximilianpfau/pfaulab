 abstract = {PURPOSE: To systematically assess the ability to detect change
and retest reliability for a panel of visual function
assessments in ABCA4 retinopathy. DESIGN: Prospective natural
history study (NCT01736293). METHODS: Patients with at least 1
documented pathogenic ABCA4 variant and a clinical phenotype
consistent with ABCA4 retinopathy were recruited from a tertiary
referral center. Participants underwent longitudinal,
multifaceted functional testing, including measures of function
at fixation (best-corrected visual acuity, low-vision Cambridge
Color Test), macular function (microperimetry), and retina-wide
function (full-field electroretinography [ERG]). Two- and 5-year
ability to detect change was determined based on the $η$2
statistic. RESULTS: A total of 134 eyes from 67 participants
with a mean follow-up of 3.65 years were included. In the 2-year
interval, the microperimetry-derived perilesional sensitivity
($η$2 of 0.73 [0.53, 0.83]; -1.79 dB/y [-2.2, -1.37]) and
mean sensitivity ($η$2 of 0.62 [0.38, 0.76]; -1.28 dB/y
[-1.67, -0.89]) showed most change over time, but could only be
recorded in 71.6% of the participants. In the 5-year interval,
the dark-adapted ERG a- and b-wave amplitude showed marked
change over time as well (eg, DA 30 a-wave amplitude with an
$η$2 of 0.54 [0.34, 0.68]; -0.02 log10(µV)/y [-0.02, -0.01]).
The genotype explained a large fraction of variability in the
ERG-based age of disease initiation (adjusted R2 of 0.73)
CONCLUSIONS: Microperimetry-based clinical outcome assessments
were most sensitive to change but could only be acquired in a
subset of participants. Across a 5-year interval, the ERG DA 30
a-wave amplitude was sensitive to disease progression,
potentially allowing for more inclusive clinical trial designs
encompassing the whole ABCA4 retinopathy spectrum.},
