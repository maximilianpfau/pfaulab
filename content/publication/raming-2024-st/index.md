abstract: "Background/Objectives: To assess the frequency, extent, localization and\
  \ potential progression of optic disc drusen (ODD) and the correlation with the\
  \ angioid streak (AS) length and retinal atrophy in patients with pseudoxanthoma\
  \ elasticum (PXE). Methods: This retrospective study included patient data from\
  \ a dedicated PXE clinic at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn,\
  \ Germany (observation period from February 2008 to July 2023). Two readers evaluated\
  \ the presence, localization, and the extent of the ODD on fundus autofluorescence\
  \ (FAF) imaging at baseline and the follow-up assessments. Additionally, we measured\
  \ the length of the longest AS visible at baseline and follow-up and the area of\
  \ atrophy at baseline, both on FAF. Results: A total of 150 eyes of 75 PXE patients\
  \ (median age at baseline 51.8 years, IRQ 46.3; 57.5 years, 49 female) underwent\
  \ retrospective analysis. At baseline, 23 of 75 patients exhibited ODD in a minimum\
  \ of one eye, resulting in an ODD prevalence of 30.7% in our cohort of PXE patients.\
  \ Among these, 14 patients showed monocular and 9 binocular ODD that were localized\
  \ predominantly nasally (46.9%). During the observational period (mean 97.5 $±$\
  \ 44.7 months), only one patient developed de novo ODD in one eye and one other\
  \ patient showed a progression in the size of the existing ODD. The group of patients\
  \ with ODD had significantly longer ASs (median 7020 µm, IQR 4604; 9183, vs. AS\
  \ length without ODD: median 4404 µm, IQR 3512; 5965, p < 0.001). No association\
  \ with the size of the atrophy was found at baseline (p = 0.27). Conclusions: This\
  \ study demonstrates a prevalence of ODD of 30.7%. ODD presence is associated with\
  \ longer ASs (an indicator of the severity and extent of ocular Bruch's membrane\
  \ calcification), suggesting that ODD formation is tightly related to ectopic calcification-possibly\
  \ secondary to calcification of the lamina cribrosa. Prospective studies investigating\
  \ the impact of ODD (in conjunction with intraocular pressure) on visual function\
  \ in PXE warrant consideration."
