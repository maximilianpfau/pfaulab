abstract: "OS and RPE thickness were the most important features for the prediction of retinal sensitivity. 'Inferred sensitivity', herein, enables to accurately estimate differential effects of retinal microstructure on spatially-resolved function in Stargardt disease, and might be used as quasi-functional surrogate marker for a refined and time-efficient investigation of possible functionally relevant treatment effects or disease progression."
