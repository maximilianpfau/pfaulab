 abstract = {[0.49, 0.72] for the OS. An additive model of allele severity explained 52.7% of variability in the age of criterion EZ-loss.CONCLUSIONPatients with ABCA4-associated retinopathy exhibited significant alterations of photoreceptors outside of EZ-loss. DL-based analysis of photoreceptor laminae may help monitor disease progression and estimate the severity of ABCA4 variants.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01736293.FUNDINGNational Eye Institute Intramural Research Program and German Research Foundation grant PF950/1-1.},
