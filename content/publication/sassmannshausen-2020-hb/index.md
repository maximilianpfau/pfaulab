abstract: 'Purpose: To examine longitudinal changes of retinal thickness and retinal
  sensitivity in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD)
  and predominantly reticular pseudodrusen (RPD). Methods: At baseline 30 eyes of
  25 iAMD patients underwent optical coherence tomography imaging, mesopic and scotopic
  fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) with follow-up examinations at month 12 (20 eyes),
  24 (12 eyes), and 36 (11 eyes). Thicknesses of different retinal layers and results
  of FCP testing (n = 56 stimuli) were spatially and longitudinally analyzed using
  linear mixed-effects models. Results: At baseline, the thickness of the partial
  outer retinal layer (pORL, 70.21 vs. 77.47 Âµm) and both mesopic (16.60 vs. 18.72
  dB) and scotopic (12.14 vs. 18.67 dB) retinal sensitivity were decreased in areas
  with RPD compared with unremarkable areas (P < 0.001). Over three years, mean change
  of pORL was -0.66 normative standard deviation (SD; i.e., z-score, P < 0.001) for
  regions with existing RPD, -0.40 SD (P < 0.001) for regions with new occurring RPD,
  and -0.17 SD (P = 0.041) in unremarkable regions. Decrease of scotopic and mesopic
  sensitivity over three years was more pronounced in areas with existing (-3.51 and
  -7.76 dB) and new occurring RPD (-2.06 and -5.97 dB). Structure-function analysis
  revealed that 1 SD decrease of pORL thickness was associated with a sensitivity
  reduction of 3.47 dB in scotopic and 0.79 dB in mesopic testing. Conclusions: This
  study demonstrates progressive outer retinal degeneration and impairment of photoreceptor
  function in eyes with iAMD and RPD over three years. Preservation of outer retinal
  thickness and reduction of RPD formation may constitute meaningful surrogate endpoints
  in interventional trials on eyes with AMD and RPD aiming to slow outer retinal degeneration.'
