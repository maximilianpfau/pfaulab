 abstract = {PURPOSE: Tamoxifen-induced retinopathy (TR) and macular
telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) share a highly similar retinal
phenotype. In this study, we aimed to evaluate differences and
similarities that may point toward underlying mechanisms linking
both disease entities. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross sectional
study. SUBJECTS: Patients diagnosed with MacTel or TR. METHODS:
Patients underwent multimodal retinal imaging, including color
fundus photography, spectral-domain OCT, fundus
autofluorescence, fluorescein angiography, and OCT angiography
(if available). Age, age of onset, best-corrected visual acuity,
and bilaterality of changes were evaluated. Patients' eyes were
graded for different morphologic characteristics by 4
experienced graders. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phenotypical
characterization and comparison of frequencies of retinal
characteristics of TR and MacTel on multimodal imaging. RESULTS:
Twenty-eight eyes of 14 patients with TR and 118 eyes of 59
patients with MacTel were included. Age, age of onset, and
best-corrected visual acuity were similar in both cohorts. All
but 1 patient showed bilateral changes. In patients with MacTel,
neurodegenerative changes and vascular alterations were equally
present, whereas in patients with TR, neurodegenerative changes
usually prevailed. Predilection sites within the central retina
differed between the 2 diseases: most findings in patients with
TR were limited to the foveal center, whereas changes in
patients with MacTel were present throughout a slightly larger
region (``MacTel area''), with an epicenter temporal to the
foveal center. Distinct morphologic features included the
distribution of retinal crystals, the size and position of
ellipsoid zone breaks, and the presence of hyperreflective
changes on OCT images. Focal hyperpigmentation and neovascular
membranes were only present in eyes with MacTel. CONCLUSIONS:
Macular telangiectasia and TR share a highly similar retinal
phenotype, especially in early disease stages. Subtle
differences on multimodal retinal images may help distinguish
between these 2 disease entities. Our findings indicate the
involvement of MÃ¼ller cells in both diseases, which may
explain the observed phenotypic characteristics and
similarities.},
