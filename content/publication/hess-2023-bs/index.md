abstract: "PURPOSE: Tamoxifen-induced retinopathy (TR) and macular telangiectasia\
  \ type 2 (MacTel) share a highly similar retinal phenotype. In this study, we aimed\
  \ to evaluate differences and similarities that may point toward underlying mechanisms\
  \ linking both disease entities. DESIGN: Retrospective, cross sectional study. SUBJECTS:\
  \ Patients diagnosed with MacTel or TR. METHODS: Patients underwent multimodal retinal\
  \ imaging, including color fundus photography, spectral-domain OCT, fundus autofluorescence,\
  \ fluorescein angiography, and OCT angiography (if available). Age, age of onset,\
  \ best-corrected visual acuity, and bilaterality of changes were evaluated. Patients'\
  \ eyes were graded for different morphologic characteristics by 4 experienced graders.\
  \ MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Phenotypical characterization and comparison of frequencies\
  \ of retinal characteristics of TR and MacTel on multimodal imaging. RESULTS: Twenty-eight\
  \ eyes of 14 patients with TR and 118 eyes of 59 patients with MacTel were included.\
  \ Age, age of onset, and best-corrected visual acuity were similar in both cohorts.\
  \ All but 1 patient showed bilateral changes. In patients with MacTel, neurodegenerative\
  \ changes and vascular alterations were equally present, whereas in patients with\
  \ TR, neurodegenerative changes usually prevailed. Predilection sites within the\
  \ central retina differed between the 2 diseases: most findings in patients with\
  \ TR were limited to the foveal center, whereas changes in patients with MacTel\
  \ were present throughout a slightly larger region (``MacTel area''), with an epicenter\
  \ temporal to the foveal center. Distinct morphologic features included the distribution\
  \ of retinal crystals, the size and position of ellipsoid zone breaks, and the presence\
  \ of hyperreflective changes on OCT images. Focal hyperpigmentation and neovascular\
  \ membranes were only present in eyes with MacTel. CONCLUSIONS: Macular telangiectasia\
  \ and TR share a highly similar retinal phenotype, especially in early disease stages.\
  \ Subtle differences on multimodal retinal images may help distinguish between these\
  \ 2 disease entities. Our findings indicate the involvement of MÃ¼ller cells in both\
  \ diseases, which may explain the observed phenotypic characteristics and similarities."
