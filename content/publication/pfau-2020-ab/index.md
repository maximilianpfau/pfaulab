abstract: 'Importance: Sensitive outcome measures for disease progression are needed
  for treatment trials in geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular
  degeneration (AMD). Objective: To quantify photoreceptor degeneration outside regions
  of GA in eyes with nonexudative AMD, to evaluate its association with future GA
  progression, and to characterize its spatio-temporal progression. Design, Setting,
  and Participants: Monocenter cohort study (Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy
  [NCT02051998]) and analysis of data from a normative data study at a tertiary referral
  center. One hundred fifty-eight eyes of 89 patients with a mean (SD) age of 77.7
  (7.1) years, median area of GA of 8.87 mm2 (IQR, 4.09-15.60), and median follow-up
  of 1.1 years (IQR, 0.52-1.7 years), as well as 93 normal eyes from 93 participants.
  Exposures: Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) volume
  scans (121 B-scans across 30° $times$ 25°) were segmented with a deep-learning pipeline
  and standardized in a pointwise manner with age-adjusted normal data (z scores).
  Outer nuclear layer (ONL), photoreceptor inner segment (IS), and outer segment (OS)
  thickness were quantified along evenly spaced contour lines surrounding GA lesions.
  Linear mixed models were applied to assess the association between photoreceptor-related
  imaging features and GA progression rates and characterize the pattern of photoreceptor
  degeneration over time. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association of ONL thinning
  with follow-up time (after adjusting for age, retinal topography [z score], and
  distance to the GA boundary). Results: The study included 158 eyes of 89 patients
  (51 women and 38 men) with a mean (SD) age of 77.7 (7.1) years. The fully automated
  B-scan segmentation was accurate (dice coefficient, 0.82; 95% CI, 0.80-0.85; compared
  with manual markings) and revealed a marked interpatient variability in photoreceptor
  degeneration. The ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss-to-GA boundary distance and OS thickness
  were prognostic for future progression rates. Outer nuclear layer and IS thinning
  over time was significant even when adjusting for age and proximity to the GA boundary
  (estimates of -0.16 $μ$m/y; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.02; and -0.17 $μ$m/y; 95% CI, -0.26
  to -0.09). Conclusions and Relevance: Distinct and progressive alterations of photoreceptor
  laminae (exceeding GA spatially) were detectable and quantifiable. The degree of
  photoreceptor degeneration outside of regions of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy
  varied markedly between eyes and was associated with future GA progression. Macula-wide
  photoreceptor laminae thinning represents a potential candidate end point to monitor
  treatment effects beyond mere GA lesion size progression.'
