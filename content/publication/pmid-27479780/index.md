abstract: "To survey the clinical responses to treatment of chronic postoperative and uveitic cystoid macular edema (CME) with a dexamethasone-based intravitreal implant (Ozurdex(®)). This retrospective, interventional case series reports on patients with chronic CME after uncomplicated vitrectomy for epiretinal gliosis or phacoemulsification (group 1: 12 eyes) or secondary to noninfectious endogenous uveitis (group 2: 36 eyes). Central retinal thickness (CRT), best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA, logMAR), and intraocular pressure (IOP) throughout follow-up were gleaned from the medical records. 0.05) at 1 and 3 months of follow-up and before reimplantation, respectively. A significant IOP increase was not observed in either group. Mean time to reimplantation of Ozurdex was 6.4 ± 5.7 and 6.6 ± 3.4 months for postoperative and uveitic CME, respectively. Ozurdex seems to achieve a sustained effect over up to 6 months in postsurgical and uveitic CME."
