abstract: "0.3LogMAR in up to 85.31% of eyes. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed that foveal status was the most important feature for BCVA prediction, while the thickness of outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor inner and outer segments as well as age of onset highly ranked for all predictions. 'Inferred ERG', 'inferred visual impairment', and 'inferred BCVA', herein, represent accurate estimates of differential functional effects of retinal microstructure, and offer quasi-functional parameters with the potential for a refined patient assessment, and investigation of potential future treatment effects or disease progression."
