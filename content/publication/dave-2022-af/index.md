abstract: "Purpose: To investigate potential associations between renal function and\
  \ age-related macular degeneration (AMD) features as assessed with multimodal retinal\
  \ imaging. Methods: A subset of participants included in a dark adaptation study\
  \ with varying AMD severities had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values\
  \ (mL/min/1.73 m2) obtained from renal function laboratory testing of serum creatinine\
  \ and cystatin C. Multimodal imaging from visit dates associated with serum samples\
  \ was graded by the Wisconsin Reading Center for AMD features. Associations of eGFR\
  \ with AMD features and severity grades, age, smoker status and rod-intercept time\
  \ were investigated. Simple univariate analyses, age-corrected multivariate analyses,\
  \ and a feature-selecting least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression\
  \ were performed for eGFR as a continuous dependent variable. Results: A total of\
  \ 110 patients (mean age, 75.1 $±$ 9.4 years; mean eGFR, 70.7 $±$ 18.2 mL/min/1.73\
  \ m2) were included. In univariate analyses age (estimate, -1.16 units/year; 95%\
  \ confidence interval [CI], -1.46 to -0.87; P < 0.0001), rod-intercept time (estimate,\
  \ -0.54 units/minute; 95% CI, -0.81 to -0.27; P < 0.001) and subretinal drusenoid\
  \ deposits (-11.12 units for subretinal drusenoid deposit presence in either eye;\
  \ 95% CI, -20.23 to -2.01; P = 0.017) were associated with decreased renal function.\
  \ However, in age-corrected multivariate models, age was the only significant variable\
  \ associated with renal function, confirmed by least absolute shrinkage and selection\
  \ operator regression. Conclusions: Accounting for age, renal function parameters\
  \ did not show an association with AMD features. Translational Relevance: Bruch's\
  \ membrane of the eye and the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney share physiologic\
  \ similarities such that decreased renal function may demonstrate associations with\
  \ AMD phenotypes."
