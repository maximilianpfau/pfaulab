abstract: "To determine the retest variability of mesopic and two-color dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP), to evaluate the predictive value of patient reliability indices, and to analyze the extent of impairment of rod- and cone function in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). = 28) underwent duplicate testing for retest reliability assessment. Mixed models were used for analysis of the hierarchical data. 0.001). The relatively greater degree of DA cyan versus DA red sensitivity loss indicates preferential rod vulnerability in nAMD, and qualifies rod function-based outcomes measures as potential sensitive and early markers of treatment response in nAMD. The S-MAIA allows reliable testing of mesopic, DA cyan, and DA red sensitivity in patients with nAMD. Patient reliability indices may serve as eligibility criteria for clinical trials to identify patients with adequate retest reliability."
