abstract: "BACKGROUND/AIMS: To evaluate the applicability of mesopic light sensitivity\
  \ measurements obtained by fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also termed 'microperimetry')\
  \ as clinical trial endpoint in Stargardt disease (STGD1). METHODS: In this retrospective,\
  \ monocentre cohort study, 271 eyes of 136 patients (age, 37.1 years) with STGD1\
  \ and 87 eyes of 54 healthy controls (age, 41.0 years) underwent mesopic FCP, using\
  \ a pattern of 50 stimuli (achromatic, 400-800 nm) centred on the fovea. The concurrent\
  \ validity of mesopic FCP testing using the MAIA device (CenterVue, Italy), the\
  \ retest variability and its determinants, and the progression of sensitivity loss\
  \ over time were investigated using mixed-model analyses. The main outcomes were\
  \ the average pointwise sensitivity loss in dependence of patients' demographic,\
  \ functional and imaging characteristics, the intrasession 95% coefficient of repeatability,\
  \ and the pointwise sensitivity loss over time. RESULTS: Pointwise sensitivity loss\
  \ was on average (estimate (95% CI)) 13.88 dB (12.55 to 15.21) along the horizontal\
  \ meridian and was significantly associated with the electrophysiological subgroup,\
  \ presence/absence of foveal sparing, best-corrected visual acuity and disease duration.\
  \ The 95% coefficient of repeatability was 12.15 dB (10.78 to 13.38) and varied\
  \ in dependence of the underlying mean sensitivity and local sensitivity slope.\
  \ The global progression rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45 dB/year (0.13 to\
  \ 0.78) and was higher for the central and inner ETDRS subfields compared with more\
  \ peripheral regions. CONCLUSIONS: Mesopic light sensitivity measured by FCP is\
  \ reliable and susceptible for functional changes. It constitutes a potential clinical\
  \ outcome for both natural history studies as well as future interventional studies\
  \ in patients with STGD1."
