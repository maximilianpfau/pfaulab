abstract: "Purpose: To investigate residual sensitivity within geographic atrophy\
  \ (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration. Methods: Mesopic and dark-adapted\
  \ (DA) cyan and red light sensitivity (Goldmann III) were investigated using fundus-controlled\
  \ perimetry (microperimetry). Test points were placed within GA along an ``iso-hull''\
  \ with a distance of -0.645° to the atrophy boundary. The false-positive response\
  \ rate was determined with suprathreshold stimuli to the optic disc (Heijl-Krakau\
  \ method) and used to compute the expected sensitivity measurements for the assumption\
  \ of absolute scotomata. The outermost visible retinal layer on spectral-domain\
  \ optical coherence tomography at the location of each test point was determined.\
  \ Results: Thirty eyes of 36 patients (75.55 $±$ 7.93 years; 19 female) from the\
  \ prospective natural history study Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (NCT02051998),\
  \ with a total of 1380 threshold determinations were analyzed. The measured sensitivities\
  \ were significantly (P < 0.01) higher than the expected values for absolute scotomata\
  \ (mean $±$ standard error of +6.92 $±$ 0.86 dB for mesopic, +2.57 $±$ 0.56 dB for\
  \ DA cyan, and +4.93 $±$ 0.74 dB for DA red testing). For mesopic testing and DA\
  \ red testing, the presence of a residual outer nuclear layer had a significant\
  \ effect on this discrepancy (P < 0.001). There was no effect of fixation stability\
  \ or any other reliability index on this discrepancy. Conclusions: Measured sensitivities\
  \ within the inner junctional zone of GA may not be purely explained by patient-specific\
  \ false-positive response rates or other reliability indices. The marked influence\
  \ of the outer retinal configuration on measured sensitivity may be indicative of\
  \ residual cone function within GA at the inner junctional zone."
