abstract: Preservation of photoreceptors beyond areas of retinal pigment epithelium
  atrophy is a critical treatment goal in eyes with geographic atrophy (GA) to prevent
  vision loss. Thus, we assessed the association of treatment with the complement
  C3 inhibitor pegcetacoplan with optical coherence tomography (OCT)-based photoreceptor
  laminae thicknesses in this post hoc analysis of the FILLY trial (NCT02503332).
  Retinal layers in OCT were segmented using a deep-learning-based pipeline and extracted
  along evenly spaced contour-lines surrounding areas of GA. The primary outcome measure
  was change from baseline in (standardized) outer nuclear layer (ONL) thickness at
  the 5.16°-contour-line at month 12. Participants treated with pegcetacoplan monthly
  had a thicker ONL along the 5.16° contour-line compared to the pooled sham arm (mean
  difference [95% CI] + 0.29 z-score units [0.16, 0.42], P < 0.001). The same was
  evident for eyes treated with pegcetacoplan every other month (+ 0.26 z-score units
  [0.13, 0.4], P < 0.001). Additionally, eyes treated with pegcetacoplan exhibited
  a thicker photoreceptor inner segment layer along the 5.16°-contour-line at month
  12. These findings suggest that pegcetacoplan could slow GA progression and lead
  to reduced thinning of photoreceptor layers beyond the GA boundary. Future trials
  in earlier disease stages, i.e., intermediate AMD, aiming to slow photoreceptor
  degeneration warrant consideration.
