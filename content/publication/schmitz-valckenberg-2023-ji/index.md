abstract: "OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability to evaluate changes over time of individual\
  \ lesions of incomplete or complete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal\
  \ atrophy (iRORA and cRORA, respectively) in patients with intermediate age-related\
  \ macular degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: OCT images from patients enrolled in Proxima\
  \ B clinical trial (NCT02399072) were utilized. PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled\
  \ in the Proxima B clinical trial, from the cohort with geographic atrophy (GA)\
  \ in 1 eye and iAMD in the other eye at baseline, were included. METHODS: Junior\
  \ and senior readers analyzed OCT images for the qualitative presence of 9 distinct\
  \ early atrophic features (presence of zone of choroidal hypertransmission, attenuation\
  \ and/or disruption of RPE, disruption of ellipsoid zone [EZ] and external limiting\
  \ membrane [ELM], outer nuclear layer [ONL] thinning, outer plexiform layer [OPL]/inner\
  \ nuclear layer [INL] subsidence, and hyporeflective wedge-shaped band). If deemed\
  \ ``present,'' 7 features were quantified with a predefined tolerance level of 50\
  \ $μ$m (diameter for the zone of choroidal hypertransmission, zone of attenuation\
  \ and/or disruption of the RPE, outer retinal thickness left/right vertical diameter,\
  \ outer retinal thickness thinnest vertical diameter, annotation of EZ, and ELM\
  \ disruption). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interreader agreements for qualitative assessments\
  \ ($ąppa$-type statistics) and quantitative measurements (Bland-Altman statistics)\
  \ were assessed. Progression of the lesion features over time was described. RESULTS:\
  \ Moderate agreement was found for presence of choroidal hypertransmission ($p̨pa$\
  \ = 0.54), followed by ELM disruption ($kp̨a$ = 0.58), OPL/INL subsidence ($kaą$\
  \ = 0.46), and a hyporeflective wedge-shaped band ($kap$̨ = 0.47). Quantification\
  \ measurements showed that choroidal hypertransmission had the highest agreement,\
  \ whereas RPE attenuation/disruption had the lowest agreement. Longitudinal adjudicated\
  \ changes for quantitative measurements of lesion progression showed that choroidal\
  \ hypertransmission and ELM disruption showed significant progression, whereas EZ\
  \ disruption and RPE attenuation/disruption did not. CONCLUSIONS: The ability to\
  \ evaluate changes over time for specific features of iRORA and cRORA was explored.\
  \ The most robust biomarker was found to be choroidal hypertransmission, followed\
  \ by ELM disruption and the qualitative markers of OPL/INL subsidence, as well as\
  \ a wedge-shaped band. Disease progression over time could be assessed by some,\
  \ but not all, spectral-domain OCT features that were explored. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S):\
