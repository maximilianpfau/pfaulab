 abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the ability to evaluate changes over time
of individual lesions of incomplete or complete retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA and cRORA,
respectively) in patients with intermediate age-related macular
degeneration (iAMD). DESIGN: OCT images from patients enrolled
in Proxima B clinical trial (NCT02399072) were utilized.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients enrolled in the Proxima B clinical trial,
from the cohort with geographic atrophy (GA) in 1 eye and iAMD
in the other eye at baseline, were included. METHODS: Junior and
senior readers analyzed OCT images for the qualitative presence
of 9 distinct early atrophic features (presence of zone of
choroidal hypertransmission, attenuation and/or disruption of
RPE, disruption of ellipsoid zone [EZ] and external limiting
membrane [ELM], outer nuclear layer [ONL] thinning, outer
plexiform layer [OPL]/inner nuclear layer [INL] subsidence, and
hyporeflective wedge-shaped band). If deemed ``present,'' 7
features were quantified with a predefined tolerance level of 50
$μ$m (diameter for the zone of choroidal hypertransmission,
zone of attenuation and/or disruption of the RPE, outer retinal
thickness left/right vertical diameter, outer retinal thickness
thinnest vertical diameter, annotation of EZ, and ELM
disruption). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Interreader agreements for
qualitative assessments ($ąppa$-type statistics) and
quantitative measurements (Bland-Altman statistics) were
assessed. Progression of the lesion features over time was
described. RESULTS: Moderate agreement was found for presence of
choroidal hypertransmission ($\p̨pa$ = 0.54), followed by ELM
disruption ($\kp̨a$ = 0.58), OPL/INL subsidence ($\kaą$ =
0.46), and a hyporeflective wedge-shaped band ($\kap$̨ = 0.47).
Quantification measurements showed that choroidal
hypertransmission had the highest agreement, whereas RPE
attenuation/disruption had the lowest agreement. Longitudinal
adjudicated changes for quantitative measurements of lesion
progression showed that choroidal hypertransmission and ELM
disruption showed significant progression, whereas EZ disruption
and RPE attenuation/disruption did not. CONCLUSIONS: The ability
to evaluate changes over time for specific features of iRORA and
cRORA was explored. The most robust biomarker was found to be
choroidal hypertransmission, followed by ELM disruption and the
qualitative markers of OPL/INL subsidence, as well as a
wedge-shaped band. Disease progression over time could be
assessed by some, but not all, spectral-domain OCT features that
were explored. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or
