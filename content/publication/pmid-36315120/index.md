abstract: "This study investigates deep-learning (DL) sequence modeling techniques to reliably fit dark adaptation (DA) curves and estimate their key parameters in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to improve robustness and curve predictions. A long-short-term memory autoencoder was used as the DL method to model the DA curve. The performance was compared against the classical nonlinear regression method using goodness-of-fit and repeatability metrics. Experiments were performed to predict the latter portion of the curve using data from early measurements. The prediction accuracy was quantified as the rod intercept time (RIT) prediction error between predicted and actual curves. 18.6 minutes RIT error for the classical method. The parameters obtained from the DL method demonstrated superior robustness as well as predictability of the curve. These could provide important advances in using multiple DA curve parameters to characterize AMD severity. Dark adaptation is an important functional measure in studies of AMD and curve modeling using DL methods can lead to improved clinical trial end points."
