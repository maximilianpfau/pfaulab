abstract: "Quantification of the relative ellipsoid zone reflectivity (rEZR) might\
  \ be a structural surrogate parameter for an early disease progression in the context\
  \ of age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Within the European multicenter, cross-sectional\
  \ MACUSTAR study, we have devised an automatic approach to determine the mean rEZR\
  \ [arbitrary units, AU] at two independent visits in SD-OCT volume scans in study\
  \ participants. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to analyze the association\
  \ of AMD stage and AMD associated high-risk features including presence of pigmentary\
  \ abnormalities, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), volume of the retinal-pigment-epithelial-drusenoid-complex\
  \ (RPEDC) with the rEZR. Intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) were determined\
  \ for rEZR reliability analysis. Within the overall study cohort (301 participants),\
  \ we could observe decreased rEZR values (coefficient estimate $±$ standard error)\
  \ of - 8.05 $±$ 2.44 AU (p = 0.0011) in the intermediate and of - 22.35 $±$ 3.28\
  \ AU (p < 0.0001) in the late AMD group. RPD presence was significantly associated\
  \ with the rEZR in iAMD eyes (- 6.49 $±$ 3.14 AU; p = 0.0403), while there was a\
  \ good ICC of 0.846 (95% confidence interval: 0.809; 0.876) in the overall study\
  \ cohort. This study showed an association of rEZR with increasing disease severity\
  \ and the presence of iAMD high-risk features. Further studies are necessary to\
  \ evaluate the rEZR's value as a novel biomarker for AMD and disease progression."
