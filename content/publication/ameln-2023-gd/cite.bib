 abstract = {PURPOSE: To investigate foveal photoreceptor configuration in
Alport syndrome, a rare inherited disease characterized by
Collagen IV dysfunction. METHODS: Adaptive optics scanning laser
ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) in vivo imaging of the foveal center and
quantitative analysis of cone photoreceptor topography in a
17-year-old male patient with Alport syndrome presenting absence
of a foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and foveal hypoplasia in both
eyes. RESULTS: Cone density analysis based on AOSLO images
revealed an unusual linear cone topography profile displaying
supernormal densities within the fovea (z-scores up to + 3.57
and + 2.97 in right and left eyes, respectively). CONCLUSION:
Foveal hypoplasia has previously been associated with normal or
reduced cone density. Our observation is the first case of
disease-related supernormal cone density within the foveola,
shedding light upon the role of Collagen IV in foveal
maturation.},
