abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate foveal photoreceptor configuration in Alport syndrome,
  a rare inherited disease characterized by Collagen IV dysfunction. METHODS: Adaptive
  optics scanning laser ophthalmoscope (AOSLO) in vivo imaging of the foveal center
  and quantitative analysis of cone photoreceptor topography in a 17-year-old male
  patient with Alport syndrome presenting absence of a foveal avascular zone (FAZ)
  and foveal hypoplasia in both eyes. RESULTS: Cone density analysis based on AOSLO
  images revealed an unusual linear cone topography profile displaying supernormal
  densities within the fovea (z-scores up to + 3.57 and + 2.97 in right and left eyes,
  respectively). CONCLUSION: Foveal hypoplasia has previously been associated with
  normal or reduced cone density. Our observation is the first case of disease-related
  supernormal cone density within the foveola, shedding light upon the role of Collagen
  IV in foveal maturation.'
