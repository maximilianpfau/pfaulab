abstract: 'PURPOSE: To evaluate the utility of optical coherence tomography-angiography
  (OCT-A) for monitoring activity, progression and response to therapy of neovascularisations
  (NVs) secondary to macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel). METHODS: In a retrospective
  analysis, eyes with NVs secondary to MacTel were reviewed over a period of $â‰¥$8
  months. Examinations at monthly intervals included visual acuity testing, dilated
  funduscopy, spectral domain-OCT and OCT-A. Eyes were treated with intravitreal VEGF
  (vascular endothelial growth factor)-inhibitors following a pro-re-nata (PRN) regime,
  and treatment decisions were based on morphological signs of activity as determined
  by B-scan OCT and funduscopy. Signs of neovascular activity were defined as an increase
  in retinal thickness, presence/increase of intraretinal/subretinal fluid and haemorrhages.
  RESULTS: A total of 19 eyes from 17 patients were analysed. Patients were evaluated
  over a mean period of 13.4 months (range: 8.9 to 24.2). OCT-A permitted the monitoring
  of both treatment effects (regression) and progression (growth) of NVs, but not
  neovascular activity. The growth of neovascular vessels was detectable in OCT-A
  before signs of activity occurred on OCT. NVs showed a progressive growth over time
  despite PRN-treatment and preferentially grew and extended within areas characterised
  by a focal reduction of choriocapillaris perfusion. CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate
  that OCT-A represents a useful imaging modality for monitoring NV-progression and
  treatment effects in MacTel. We demonstrate its advantages over conventional B-scan
  OCT imaging, including an earlier detection of NV-progression, and propose an adjustment
  of the current OCT-controlled PRN treatment regime in order to prevent NV-progression
  and subsequent functional loss in neovascular MacTel.'
