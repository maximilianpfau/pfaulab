abstract: 'BACKGROUND: To model the progression of geographic atrophy (GA) in patients
  with age-related macular degeneration (AMD) by building a suitable statistical regression
  model for GA size measurements obtained from fundus autofluorescence imaging. METHODS:
  Based on theoretical considerations, we develop a linear mixed-effects model for
  GA size progression that incorporates covariable-dependent enlargement rates as
  well as correlations between longitudinally collected GA size measurements. To capture
  nonlinear progression in a flexible way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations
  with different transformation parameters $łambda$. Model evaluation is performed
  on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective multi-center cohort studies
  on GA size progression. RESULTS: A transformation parameter of $łambda$=0.45 yielded
  the best model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When hypertension
  and hypercholesterolemia were included as risk factors in the model, they showed
  an association with progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this
  model was 67.21$±$6.49 years. CONCLUSIONS: We provide a comprehensive framework
  for modeling the course of uni- or bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal
  observational studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset estimation,
  identification of risk factors and prediction of future GA size. A square-root transformation
  of atrophy size is recommended before model fitting.'
