abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of
  irreversible vision loss among individuals older than 50 years. Although considerable
  advances have been made in our understanding of AMD genetics, the differential effects
  of major associated loci on disease manifestation and progression may not be well
  characterized. OBJECTIVE: To elucidate the specific associations of the 2 most common
  genetic risk loci for AMD, the CFH-CFHR5 locus on chromosome 1q32 (Chr1) and the
  ARMS2/HTRA1 locus on chromosome 10q26 (Chr10)-independent of one another and in
  combination-with time to conversion to late-stage disease and to visual acuity loss.
  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This case series study included 502 individuals
  who were homozygous for risk variants at both Chr1 and Chr10 (termed Chr1&10-risk)
  or at either Chr1 (Chr1-risk) or Chr10 (Chr10-risk) and who had enrolled in Genetic
  and Molecular Studies of Eye Diseases at the Sharon Eccles Steele Center for Translational
  Medicine between September 2009 and March 2020. Multimodal imaging data were reviewed
  for AMD staging, including grading of incomplete and complete retinal pigment epithelium
  and outer retinal atrophy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Hazard ratios and survival
  times for conversion to any late-stage AMD, atrophic or neovascular, and associated
  vision loss of 2 or more lines. RESULTS: In total, 317 participants in the Chr1-risk
  group (median [IQR] age at first visit, 75.6 [69.5-81.7] years; 193 women [60.9%]),
  93 participants in the Chr10-risk group (median [IQR] age at first visit, 77.5 [72.2-84.2]
  years; 62 women [66.7%]), and 92 participants in the Chr1&10-risk group (median
  [IQR] age at first visit, 71.7 [68.0-76.3] years; 62 women [67.4%]) were included
  in the analyses. After adjusting for age and AMD grade at first visit, compared
  with 257 participants in the Chr1-risk group, 56 participants in the Chr1&10-risk
  group (factor of 3.3 [95% CI, 1.6-6.8]; P < .001) and 58 participants in the Chr10-risk
  group (factor of 2.6 [95% CI, 1.3-5.2]; P = .007) were more likely to convert to
  a late-stage phenotype during follow-up. This difference was mostly associated with
  conversion to macular neovascularization, which occurred earlier in participants
  with Chr1&10-risk and Chr10-risk. Eyes in the Chr1&10-risk group (median [IQR] survival,
  5.7 [2.1-11.1] years) were 2.1 (95% CI, 1.1-3.9; P = .03) times as likely and eyes
  in the Chr10-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 6.3 [2.7-11.3] years) were 1.8 (95%
  CI, 1.0-3.1; P = .05) times as likely to experience a visual acuity loss of 2 or
  more lines compared with eyes of the Chr1-risk group (median [IQR] survival, 9.4
  [4.1-* (asterisk indicates event rate did not reach 75%)] years). CONCLUSIONS AND
  RELEVANCE: These findings suggest differential associations of the 2 major AMD-related
  risk loci with structural and functional disease progression and suggest distinct
  underlying biological mechanisms associated with these 2 loci. These genotype-phenotype
  associations may warrant consideration when designing and interpreting AMD research
  studies and clinical trials.'
