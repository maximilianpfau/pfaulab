abstract: "To determine the intrasession test-retest reliability of mesopic and dark-adapted fundus-controlled perimetry in patients with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (iAMD). We conducted a cross-sectional study with 23 iAMD patients (67.3 ± 8.2 years; range, 50-85; 78% female) and 24 healthy controls (61.3 ± 5.2 years; range, 50-71; 50% female) using a modified MAIA microperimeter. All patients underwent duplicate mesopic (achromatic stimuli, 400-800 nm) and dark-adapted (red stimuli, 627 nm) microperimetry, using a grid of 33 stimuli over 14° of the central retina. Main outcome measure was the intrasession test-retest reliability for pointwise sensitivity (PWS). 0.01). The modified MAIA device allows for reliable mesopic and dark-adapted microperimetry in iAMD patients. We found that iAMD is associated with both reduced mesopic and dark-adapted retinal sensitivity."
