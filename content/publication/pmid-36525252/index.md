abstract: "To investigate potential associations between renal function and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) features as assessed with multimodal retinal imaging. A subset of participants included in a dark adaptation study with varying AMD severities had estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) values (mL/min/1.73 m2) obtained from renal function laboratory testing of serum creatinine and cystatin C. Multimodal imaging from visit dates associated with serum samples was graded by the Wisconsin Reading Center for AMD features. Associations of eGFR with AMD features and severity grades, age, smoker status and rod-intercept time were investigated. Simple univariate analyses, age-corrected multivariate analyses, and a feature-selecting least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression were performed for eGFR as a continuous dependent variable. 0.001) and subretinal drusenoid deposits (-11.12 units for subretinal drusenoid deposit presence in either eye; 95% CI, -20.23 to -2.01; P = 0.017) were associated with decreased renal function. However, in age-corrected multivariate models, age was the only significant variable associated with renal function, confirmed by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Accounting for age, renal function parameters did not show an association with AMD features. Bruch's membrane of the eye and the glomerular basement membrane of the kidney share physiologic similarities such that decreased renal function may demonstrate associations with AMD phenotypes."
