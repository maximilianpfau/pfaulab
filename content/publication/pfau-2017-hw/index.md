abstract: 'Purpose: To compare the intermodality and interreader agreement for geographic
  atrophy (GA) lesion size quantification in green-light fundus autofluorescence (GAF;
  excitation = 518 nm) versus combined blue-light fundus autofluorescence (BAF; excitation
  = 488 nm) and near-infrared reflectance (NIR; 820 nm) -based grading. Methods: Confocal
  scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO) GAF, BAF, and NIR images of 40 eyes from 29
  patients (mean age 79.7 years) with GA secondary to AMD were recorded according
  to a standardized protocol. GA areas were analyzed in GAF, BAF combined with NIR
  (BAF+NIR), or BAF alone, by four independent readers using semiautomated software
  (RegionFinder; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). A mixed-effects model
  was used to assess the effect of image modality on the measured square-root lesion
  area. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient
  (ICC) were assessed for the square-root lesion area, lesion perimeter, and circularity.
  Results: GAF-based measurements were on average 0.062 mm (95% confidence interval
  [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than BAF+NIR-based measurements and 0.077 mm (95% CI 0.06
  - 0.10 mm) larger than BAF-based measurements. Interreader agreement was highest
  for GAF-based analysis ([CR, ICC] 0.196 mm, 0.995) followed by BAF+NIR (0.232 mm,
  0.992) and BAF alone (0.263 mm, 0.991). The same was noted for the lesion perimeter
  and circularity. Post hoc review revealed that interreader differences were associated
  with media opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation to a larger
  extent in BAF than in GAF. Conclusions: cSLO-based GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging
  with semiautomated lesion delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible quantification
  of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF suggests that its
  use may be preferable in clinical trials examining the change in lesion size as
  a clinical endpoint.'
