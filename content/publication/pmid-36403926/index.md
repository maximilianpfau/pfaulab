abstract: "To analyze presence of hyperreflective foci (HRF) across different age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severities and examine its correlation with other structural and functional AMD features. Longitudinal, single-center, case-control study. 50 years old with varying AMD severities (including no AMD). Color fundus imaging was used to assess AMD severity and hyperpigmentation (PGM) presence. Subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and HRF were detected on OCT volumes. The correlations of HRF with additional AMD features were evaluated using linear and logistic mixed-effects models. One study eye per participant underwent dark adaptation (DA) testing to measure rod intercept time (RIT) for structure function associations. Eyes were followed longitudinally and changes in AMD severity and RIT were measured relative to HRF presence. The primary outcome was presence of HRF, which was compared with presence of other AMD features and DA impairment. 0.001). The progressively increased presence of HRF in higher AMD severities, and its correlation with previously associated AMD biomarkers, suggests HRF is an important OCT feature adding to the understanding of disease progression. Hyperreflective foci presence was associated with delays in DA, indicating HRF is a marker for visual cycle impairment. Proprietary or commercial disclosure may be found after the references."
