abstract: "OBJECTIVE: The primary goal of this study was to determine how structural\
  \ and functional parameters influence the vision-related quality of life (VRQoL)\
  \ in patients suffering from geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular\
  \ degeneration. DESIGN: This study was designed as a prospective, noninterventional,\
  \ natural-history study (Directional Spread in Geographic-Atrophy study, NCT02051998).\
  \ SUBJECTS: The research involved 82 patients with bilateral GA. METHODS: The study\
  \ examined parameters including GA location as assessed by the ETDRS grid, best-corrected\
  \ visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity (LLVA), reading acuity, and speed.\
  \ These parameters were then correlated with VRQoL, which was gauged using the National\
  \ Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire 25. The analysis method employed was\
  \ the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator with linear mixed-effects\
  \ models. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The central parameters measured in this study encompassed\
  \ GA area, VRQoL scores associated with different GA subfields, and the significance\
  \ of LLVA for foveal-sparing patients. RESULTS: On average, patients showed a total\
  \ GA area of 2.9 $±$ 1.2 mm2 in the better eye (BE) and 3.1 $±$ 1.3 mm2 in the worse\
  \ eye. The most significant associations with VRQoL scores for distance and near\
  \ activities were observed in the inner lower and inner left subfields of the BE,\
  \ respectively. For patients with foveal-sparing GA, the LLVA of the BE stood out\
  \ as the most influential variable across all VRQoL scales. CONCLUSIONS: The study's\
  \ findings point toward the pivotal role of GA location, especially the inner lower\
  \ and inner left subfields of the BE, in relation to VRQoL in GA patients. The LLVA's\
  \ importance becomes even more pronounced for foveal-sparing patients. These observations\
  \ highlight the need for health care professionals to better understand the association\
  \ between lesion location and patient-reported outcomes. This is critical for informing\
  \ treatment decisions and refining the planning of interventional trials. FINANCIAL\
