abstract: "To identify predictors of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in eyes with foveal-sparing geographic atrophy (GA) secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Best corrected visual acuity (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts); serial fundus autofluorescence; and near-infrared reflectance images of patients participating in the FAM (NCT00393692) and DSGA (NCT02051998) studies were analyzed. The sizes of GA and spared fovea, and the minimal linear dimension of intact retinal pigment epithelium (\"bridge\") between the residual foveal island and the surrounding retina were quantified and associations with BCVA were assessed by local regression curves and mixed effects models. 1.5 mm2 foveal-sparing size and for 400 μm bridge size. Employing these values as cutoff levels, mixed effects modeling revealed that both anatomic parameters, but not time, significantly impacted BCVA. 1.5 mm2 or if the bridge was smaller than 400 μm in width. These findings add to the understanding of the natural history of foveal-sparing GA and may support future clinical trial designs."
