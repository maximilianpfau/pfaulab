abstract: 'Purpose: To investigate the potential of optical coherence tomography (OCT)
  angiography to detect and quantify the neovascular network in exudative AMD. Methods:
  Treatment-naı̈ve eyes that were diagnosed with exudative AMD were prospectively
  examined by OCT angiography (OCT-A). The extent of the neovascular network was measured
  by three independent readers. Interclass-correlation coefficient and area overlap
  coefficients (OC) were calculated to assess locally precise agreement between measurements.
  As a reference for interreader agreement, the extent of the neovascular network
  was further measured on fluorescein angiography (FA) images. Results: A total of
  31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5 years, 15 female) were included in the study.
  Neovascularization subtype was classified as type I in 5, type II in 11, type III
  in 9, and mixed in 6 eyes, respectively. Interreader agreement for measurements
  of the neovascular network was 0.884 for OCT-A and 0.636 for FA. Overlap coefficient
  was 0.705 (interquartile [IQR]: 0.450-0.76) for OCT-A and 0.704 (IQR: 0.673-0.750)
  for FA, respectively. Area agreement was weaker in type III and mixed lesions. Conclusions:
  Optical coherence tomography angiography-based measurements of the new vessel complex
  in neovascular AMD are feasible with interreader agreement comparable with the values
  obtained for FA. The results underscore the potential of OCT-A as a noninvasive
  diagnostic tool in neovascular AMD. Yet, further studies will be required to reveal
  the origin of poor agreement observed in single eyes and to advance OCT-A toward
  dependable use (e.g., in a reading center context).'
