abstract: 'PURPOSE: To genetically characterize a subphenotype of geographic atrophy
  (GA) in AMD associated with rapid progression and a diffuse-trickling appearance
  on fundus autofluorescence imaging. METHODS: Patients from the Fundus Autofluorescence
  in Age-Related Macular Degeneration Study were phenotyped for diffuse-trickling
  GA (dt-GA; n = 44). DNA was analyzed for 10 known AMD-associated genetic variants.
  A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated and compared with patients with nondiffuse-trickling
  GA (ndt-GA; n = 311) and individuals from the 1000 genomes project (1000G; n = 267).
  Given the phenotypic overlap between diffuse-trickling and late-onset retinal degeneration
  (LORD), all C1QTNF5 exons and their exon/intron boundaries were sequenced. RESULTS:
  A statistically significant difference in allele frequencies between dt-GA and ndt-GA
  were found for CFH:rs1061170 and CFH:rs800292 (Pcorrected = 0.03). The ARMS2 variant
  rs10490924 was significantly more frequent in dt-GA than in 1000G individuals (Pcorrected
  < 0.01). The GRS of dt-GA patients was in-between the score of the 1000G individuals
  and that of patients with ndt-GA, significantly differing from both (Pcorrected
  <0.01). Sequencing of C1QTNF5 revealed 28 unique variants although none showed a
  statistically significant association with dt-GA when compared with 1000G individuals.
  CONCLUSIONS: The dt-GA phenotype shows a remarkably different genetic risk profile
  from other GA phenotypes secondary to AMD. Disease-associated C1QTNF5 mutations
  were not identified. Together, these results suggest that the dt-GA phenotype is
  associated with a genetic background substantially different from other GA phenotypes
  and underlines the necessity to refine the clinical phenotyping, specifically when
  aiming for individualized therapies in AMD.'
