 abstract = {As a disabling and frequent disease, geographic atrophy secondary to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) constitutes an important study subject. Emerging clinical trials require suitable end points. The characterization and validation of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is warranted.\\ To prospectively evaluate reading performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association with established visual function assessments and structural biomarkers.\\ The noninterventional, prospective natural history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and ended January 2021.\\ Reading acuity and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts. Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy, followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association of those variables with reading performance.\\ 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular reading performance did not differ from reading performance in the better-seeing eye.\\ The association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on the better-seeing eye.},
