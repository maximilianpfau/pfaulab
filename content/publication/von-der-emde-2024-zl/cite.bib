 abstract = {Purpose: Quantitative fundus autofluorescence (QAF) currently
deploys an age-based score to correct for lens opacification.
However, in elderly people, lens opacification varies strongly
between individuals of similar age, and innate lens
autofluorescence is not included in the current correction
formula. Our goal was to develop and compare an individualized
formula. Methods: One hundred thirty participants were examined
cross-sectionally, and a subset of 30 participants received
additional multimodal imaging 2-week post-cataract-surgery.
Imaging included the Scheimpflug principle, anterior chamber
optical coherence tomography (AC-OCT), lens quantitative
autofluorescence (LQAF), and retinal QAF imaging. Among the
subset, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator
regression and backward selection was implemented to determine
which lens score best predicts the QAF value after lens
extraction. Subsequently, a spline mixed model was applied to
the whole cohort to quantify the influence of LQAF and
Scheimpflug on QAF. Results: Age and LQAF measurements were
found to be the most relevant variables, whereas AC-OCT
measurements and Scheimpflug were eliminated by backward
selection. Both an increase in Scheimpflug and LQAF values were
associated with a decrease in QAF. The prediction error of the
spline model (mean absolute error [MAE] $±$ standard
deviation) of 32.2 $±$ 23.4 (QAF a.u.) was markedly lower
compared to the current age-based formula MAE of 96.1 $±$
93.5. Both smooth terms, LQAF (P < 0.01) and Scheimpflug (P <
0.001), were significant for the spline mixed model.
Conclusions: LQAF imaging proved to be the most predictive for
the impact of the natural lens on QAF imaging. The application
of lens scores in the clinic could improve the accuracy of QAF
imaging interpretation and might allow including aged patients
in future QAF studies.},
