abstract: 'Purpose: Quantitative fundus autofluorescence (QAF) currently deploys an
  age-based score to correct for lens opacification. However, in elderly people, lens
  opacification varies strongly between individuals of similar age, and innate lens
  autofluorescence is not included in the current correction formula. Our goal was
  to develop and compare an individualized formula. Methods: One hundred thirty participants
  were examined cross-sectionally, and a subset of 30 participants received additional
  multimodal imaging 2-week post-cataract-surgery. Imaging included the Scheimpflug
  principle, anterior chamber optical coherence tomography (AC-OCT), lens quantitative
  autofluorescence (LQAF), and retinal QAF imaging. Among the subset, least absolute
  shrinkage and selection operator regression and backward selection was implemented
  to determine which lens score best predicts the QAF value after lens extraction.
  Subsequently, a spline mixed model was applied to the whole cohort to quantify the
  influence of LQAF and Scheimpflug on QAF. Results: Age and LQAF measurements were
  found to be the most relevant variables, whereas AC-OCT measurements and Scheimpflug
  were eliminated by backward selection. Both an increase in Scheimpflug and LQAF
  values were associated with a decrease in QAF. The prediction error of the spline
  model (mean absolute error [MAE] $±$ standard deviation) of 32.2 $±$ 23.4 (QAF a.u.)
  was markedly lower compared to the current age-based formula MAE of 96.1 $±$ 93.5.
  Both smooth terms, LQAF (P < 0.01) and Scheimpflug (P < 0.001), were significant
  for the spline mixed model. Conclusions: LQAF imaging proved to be the most predictive
  for the impact of the natural lens on QAF imaging. The application of lens scores
  in the clinic could improve the accuracy of QAF imaging interpretation and might
  allow including aged patients in future QAF studies.'
