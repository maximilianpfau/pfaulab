abstract: "12 weeks), or treatment-naïve \"quiescent\" qCNV. We evaluated the qualitative and quantitative optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) features of these CNV subgroups. The presence of small-caliber vessels, peripheral arcades, and a -perilesional OCTA signal attenuation as well as values for vessel length, density, and branching index were evaluated for each CNV network in a 6 × 6 mm OCTA scan pattern. 0.03), while quantitative metrics also suggested lower values. These findings suggest that OCTA may be supportive in the phenotypical differentiation of CNV lesions secondary to AMD, while the assessed structural changes appeared to be more indicative of previously administered anti-VEGF therapy than current exudative activity."
