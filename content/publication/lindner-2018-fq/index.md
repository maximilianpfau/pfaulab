abstract: "Purpose: To assess the impact of distinct atrophy border characteristics\
  \ based on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging on local\
  \ atrophy progression. Methods: Patients with geographic atrophy (GA) secondary\
  \ to AMD were recruited in the context of the Longitudinal Fundus Autofluorescence\
  \ in Age-related Macular Degeneration and Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy\
  \ studies (NCT00393692, NCT02051998). Horizontal and vertical SD-OCT scans were\
  \ acquired at sequential visits using a device allowing for anatomically accurate\
  \ registration of follow-up to baseline scans. For quantification of local atrophy\
  \ progression, the lateral spread of GA (LSGA) was measured. Further, border types\
  \ were independently graded. Comparison of LSGA between the different border types\
  \ was performed using linear mixed-effects models. Results: Seventy-two eyes of\
  \ 49 patients (27 female) aged 74.0 years (Inter quartile range [IQR], 68.1-79.0)\
  \ were included into this analysis. A total of 258 border sections were analyzed\
  \ longitudinally over a median period of 1.2 years (IQR, 0.9-1.6). At baseline,\
  \ 17.1% borders were classified as 'regular', 47.7% as 'irregular', and 35.3% as\
  \ 'splitting'. Sixty-two percent of the eyes exhibited more than one border type.\
  \ LSGA was slowest in 'regular' borders (62.85 $±$ 25.29 $μ$m/y), followed by 'irregular'\
  \ borders (91.15 $±$ 15.05 $μ$m/y) and fastest in 'splitting' borders (183.15 $±$\
  \ 18.17 $μ$m/y). Differences between the 'splitting' and each other border type\
  \ were statistically significant (P < 0.001). Conclusions: The results indicate\
  \ that SD-OCT-based assessment of local GA border morphology can serve as a predictor\
  \ for local atrophy progression. These observations help to better understand the\
  \ natural history and potential pathogenetic factors of GA development and progression."
