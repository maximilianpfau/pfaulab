 abstract = {-contour-line at month 12. These findings suggest that pegcetacoplan could slow GA progression and lead to reduced thinning of photoreceptor layers beyond the GA boundary. Future trials in earlier disease stages, i.e., intermediate AMD, aiming to slow photoreceptor degeneration warrant consideration.},
