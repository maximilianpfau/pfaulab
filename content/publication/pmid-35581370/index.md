abstract: "Pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) occur in association with various chorioretinal diseases. With respect to the broad clinical spectrum of PEDs we describe fundus autofluorescence (FAF) characteristics of PEDs. nm). Diagnosis of PED was confirmed using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A qualitative FAF grading system was established, and grading was performed by two independent readers. 20, 21.5%). and do not necessarily correspond with the underlying PED subtype or a specific pathology."
