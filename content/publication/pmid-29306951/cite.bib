 abstract = {To evaluate two different spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) scan patterns in eyes with intermediate age-related macular degeneration (AMD) for the longitudinal assessment of drusen volume.\\ m) and in the number of averaged frames (4 vs. 15).\\ 0.103 mm3 (pattern B) (p = 0.937). Linear mixed-effect models showed no significant difference for the change within 4 years for both pattern A (p = 0.8) and pattern B (p = 0.8).\\ The results indicate that the performance of interpolation algorithms may be sufficient to balance for less dense raster scanning with regard to quantification of longitudinal drusen volume, which can be used as a surrogate marker for AMD progression in future clinical trials.},
