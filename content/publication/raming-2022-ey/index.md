abstract: "PURPOSE: To elucidate morphological determinants of rod and cone dysfunction\
  \ in Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD), and to systematically compare visual function\
  \ tests for interventional trials. DESIGN: Prospective cross-sectional study. METHODS:\
  \ Patients with SFD (n = 16) and controls (n = 20) underwent visual function testing\
  \ (best-corrected visual acuity [BCVA] and low luminance visual acuity [LLVA], contrast\
  \ sensitivity, mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) fundus-controlled perimetry [FCP],\
  \ rod-mediated dark adaptation [RMDA]), and multimodal imaging. Vision-related quality\
  \ of life was evaluated. FCP and RMDA thresholds were analyzed using mixed models\
  \ and structure-function correlation using machine learning (ML). Longitudinal data\
  \ of 1 patient with high-dose vitamin A supplementation were available. RESULTS:\
  \ Although photopic BCVA was normative in SFD, LLVA was impaired (0.30 LogMAR [0.20;\
  \ 0.45] vs 0.20 LogMAR [0.03; 0.28], P < .05). Scotopic visual function exhibited\
  \ a delayed rod-intercept time (21 minutes [12.15; 21] vs 4.05 minutes [3.22; 5.36],\
  \ P < .001), and marked DA cyan mean sensitivity loss (-11.80 dB [-3.47; -19.85]),\
  \ paralleled by a reduced vision-related quality of life. ML-based structure-function\
  \ correlation allowed prediction of mesopic, DA cyan, and red sensitivity with high\
  \ accuracy (cross-validated mean absolute error: 4.36, 7.77, and 5.31 dB, respectively),\
  \ whereas RMDA could be slowed even in the absence of fundus alterations on multimodal\
  \ imaging. After high-dose vitamin A supplementation, RMDA and DA thresholds improved\
  \ markedly. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with SFD exhibit severely impaired scotopic visual\
  \ function even in the absence of funduscopic alterations on multimodal imaging.\
  \ In contrast to BCVA, scotopic visual function tests are suitable to quantify dysfunction\
  \ in the early stages. Improvement of scotopic dysfunction after (off-label) high-dose\
  \ vitamin A intake, as observed in one patient in our study, is compatible with\
  \ the hypothesized local deficiency of vitamin A secondary to Bruch's membrane alterations."
