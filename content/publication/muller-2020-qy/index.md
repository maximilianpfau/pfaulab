abstract: "PURPOSE: To investigate the prognostic value of demographic, functional,\
  \ genetic, and imaging parameters on retinal pigment epithelium atrophy progression\
  \ secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy. METHODS: Patients with retinal pigment\
  \ epithelium atrophy secondary to ABCA4-related retinopathy were examined longitudinally\
  \ with fundus autofluorescence imaging. Lesion area, perimeter, circularity, caliper\
  \ diameters, and focality of areas with definitely decreased autofluorescence were\
  \ determined. A model was used to predict the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline\
  \ variables. Sample size calculations were performed to model the power in a simulated\
  \ interventional study. RESULTS: Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range, 14-78\
  \ years) with a follow-up time of 10 to 100 months were included. The mean annual\
  \ progression of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic\
  \ areas, the retina-wide functional impairment, and the age-of-onset category constituted\
  \ significant predictors for future retinal pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining\
  \ 25.7% of the variability. By extension of a simulated study length and/or specific\
  \ patient preselection based on these baseline characteristics, the required sample\
  \ size could significantly be reduced. CONCLUSION: Trial design based on specific\
  \ shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics and the adaption\
  \ of the trial duration may provide potential benefits in required cohort size and\
  \ absolute number of visits."
