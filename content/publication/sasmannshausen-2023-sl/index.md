abstract: 'PURPOSE: To report the prevalence and topographic distribution of structural
  characteristics in study participants with age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
  and controls in the cross-sectional study part of the MACUSTAR study (ClinicalTrials.gov
  Identifier: NCT03349801). DESIGN: European, multicenter cohort study. SUBJECTS:
  Overall, 301 eyes of 301 subjects with early (n = 34), intermediate (n = 168), and
  late AMD (n = 43), as well as eyes without any AMD features (n = 56). METHODS: In
  study eyes with intermediate AMD (iAMD), the presence of structural AMD biomarkers,
  including pigmentary abnormalities (PAs), pigment epithelium detachment (PED), refractile
  deposits, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), hyperreflective foci (HRF), incomplete/complete
  retinal pigment epithelium (RPE), and outer retinal atrophy (i/cRORA), and quiescent
  choroidal neovascularization (qCNV) was systematically determined in the prospectively
  acquired multimodal retinal imaging cross-sectional data set of MACUSTAR. Retinal
  layer thicknesses and the RPE drusen complex (RPEDC) volume were determined for
  the total study cohort in spectral-domain (SD) OCT imaging using a deep-learning-based
  algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence and topographic distribution of structural
  iAMD features. RESULTS: A total of 301 study eyes of 301 subjects with a mean ($±$
  standard deviation) age of 71.2 $±$ 7.20 years (63.1% women) were included. Besides
  large drusen, the most prevalent structural feature in iAMD study eyes were PA (57.1%),
  followed by HRF (51.8%) and RPD (22.0%). Pigment epithelium detachment lesions were
  observed in 4.8%, vitelliform lesions in 4.2%, refractile deposits in 3.0%, and
  qCNV in 2.4%. Direct precursor lesions for manifest retinal atrophy were detected
  in 10.7% (iRORA) and 4.2% (cRORA) in iAMD eyes. Overall, the highest RPEDC volume
  with a median of 98.92 $times$ 10-4 mm³ was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial analysis
  demonstrated a predominant distribution of RPD in the superior and temporal subfields
  at a foveal eccentricity of 1.5 to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct
  topographic distribution involving the foveal center. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed knowledge
  of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD biomarkers is vital to identify
  reliable outcome measure for disease progression. Longitudinal analyses are needed
  to evaluate their prognostic value for conversion to advanced disease stages. FINANCIAL
