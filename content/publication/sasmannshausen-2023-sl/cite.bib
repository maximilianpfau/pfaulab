 abstract = {PURPOSE: To report the prevalence and topographic distribution
of structural characteristics in study participants with
age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and controls in the
cross-sectional study part of the MACUSTAR study
(ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03349801). DESIGN: European,
multicenter cohort study. SUBJECTS: Overall, 301 eyes of 301
subjects with early (n = 34), intermediate (n = 168), and late
AMD (n = 43), as well as eyes without any AMD features (n = 56).
METHODS: In study eyes with intermediate AMD (iAMD), the
presence of structural AMD biomarkers, including pigmentary
abnormalities (PAs), pigment epithelium detachment (PED),
refractile deposits, reticular pseudodrusen (RPD),
hyperreflective foci (HRF), incomplete/complete retinal pigment
epithelium (RPE), and outer retinal atrophy (i/cRORA), and
quiescent choroidal neovascularization (qCNV) was systematically
determined in the prospectively acquired multimodal retinal
imaging cross-sectional data set of MACUSTAR. Retinal layer
thicknesses and the RPE drusen complex (RPEDC) volume were
determined for the total study cohort in spectral-domain (SD)
OCT imaging using a deep-learning-based algorithm. MAIN OUTCOME
MEASURES: Prevalence and topographic distribution of structural
iAMD features. RESULTS: A total of 301 study eyes of 301
subjects with a mean ($±$ standard deviation) age of 71.2
$±$ 7.20 years (63.1% women) were included. Besides large
drusen, the most prevalent structural feature in iAMD study eyes
were PA (57.1%), followed by HRF (51.8%) and RPD (22.0%).
Pigment epithelium detachment lesions were observed in 4.8%,
vitelliform lesions in 4.2%, refractile deposits in 3.0%, and
qCNV in 2.4%. Direct precursor lesions for manifest retinal
atrophy were detected in 10.7% (iRORA) and 4.2% (cRORA) in
iAMD eyes. Overall, the highest RPEDC volume with a median of
98.92 $\times$ 10-4 mm³ was found in iAMD study eyes. Spatial
analysis demonstrated a predominant distribution of RPD in the
superior and temporal subfields at a foveal eccentricity of 1.5
to 2 mm, whereas HRF and large drusen had a distinct topographic
distribution involving the foveal center. CONCLUSIONS: Detailed
knowledge of the prevalence and distribution of structural iAMD
biomarkers is vital to identify reliable outcome measure for
disease progression. Longitudinal analyses are needed to
evaluate their prognostic value for conversion to advanced
disease stages. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or
