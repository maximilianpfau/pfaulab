abstract: 'PURPOSE: To analyze presence of hyperreflective foci (HRF) across different
  age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severities and examine its correlation with
  other structural and functional AMD features. DESIGN: Longitudinal, single-center,
  case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty-eight participants aged
  > 50 years old with varying AMD severities (including no AMD). METHODS: Color fundus
  imaging was used to assess AMD severity and hyperpigmentation (PGM) presence. Subretinal
  drusenoid deposits (SDD) and HRF were detected on OCT volumes. The correlations
  of HRF with additional AMD features were evaluated using linear and logistic mixed-effects
  models. One study eye per participant underwent dark adaptation (DA) testing to
  measure rod intercept time (RIT) for structure function associations. Eyes were
  followed longitudinally and changes in AMD severity and RIT were measured relative
  to HRF presence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was presence of HRF,
  which was compared with presence of other AMD features and DA impairment. RESULTS:
  One hundred and fifty-eight participants (median baseline age of 73.1 [interquartile
  range (IQR) = 66-79] years) contributing 1277 eye visits were included. Hyperreflective
  foci (HRF) were detected more frequently in higher AMD severities. Hyperreflective-foci
  presence was significantly associated with PGM presence (odds ratio 832.9, P < 0.001)
  and SDD presence (odds ratio 9.42, P = 0.017). Eyes with HRF demonstrated significantly
  longer DA (median 27.1 [IQR = 16-40] minutes) than those without HRF (13.5 [10-22]
  minutes) but less than eyes with SDD only (40 [28-40] minutes). Highest RIT values
  were found in eyes with both HRF and SDD (40.0 [40-40] minutes). Age and HRF explained
  a similar proportion of RIT variability as age and SDD. Eyes that developed HRF
  demonstrated baseline RITs closer to eyes with HRF at baseline, compared with eyes
  that never developed HRF (29.1 [16-40], 38.5 [22-40] versus 13.1 [10-22] minutes;
  Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The progressively increased presence of
  HRF in higher AMD severities, and its correlation with previously associated AMD
  biomarkers, suggests HRF is an important OCT feature adding to the understanding
  of disease progression. Hyperreflective foci presence was associated with delays
  in DA, indicating HRF is a marker for visual cycle impairment. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S):
