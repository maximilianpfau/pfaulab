 abstract = {PURPOSE: To analyze presence of hyperreflective foci (HRF)
across different age-related macular degeneration (AMD)
severities and examine its correlation with other structural and
functional AMD features. DESIGN: Longitudinal, single-center,
case-control study. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fifty-eight
participants aged > 50 years old with varying AMD severities
(including no AMD). METHODS: Color fundus imaging was used to
assess AMD severity and hyperpigmentation (PGM) presence.
Subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD) and HRF were detected on OCT
volumes. The correlations of HRF with additional AMD features
were evaluated using linear and logistic mixed-effects models.
One study eye per participant underwent dark adaptation (DA)
testing to measure rod intercept time (RIT) for structure
function associations. Eyes were followed longitudinally and
changes in AMD severity and RIT were measured relative to HRF
presence. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was
presence of HRF, which was compared with presence of other AMD
features and DA impairment. RESULTS: One hundred and fifty-eight
participants (median baseline age of 73.1 [interquartile range
(IQR) = 66-79] years) contributing 1277 eye visits were
included. Hyperreflective foci (HRF) were detected more
frequently in higher AMD severities. Hyperreflective-foci
presence was significantly associated with PGM presence (odds
ratio 832.9, P < 0.001) and SDD presence (odds ratio 9.42, P =
0.017). Eyes with HRF demonstrated significantly longer DA
(median 27.1 [IQR = 16-40] minutes) than those without HRF (13.5
[10-22] minutes) but less than eyes with SDD only (40 [28-40]
minutes). Highest RIT values were found in eyes with both HRF
and SDD (40.0 [40-40] minutes). Age and HRF explained a similar
proportion of RIT variability as age and SDD. Eyes that
developed HRF demonstrated baseline RITs closer to eyes with HRF
at baseline, compared with eyes that never developed HRF (29.1
[16-40], 38.5 [22-40] versus 13.1 [10-22] minutes;
Kruskal-Wallis P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The progressively
increased presence of HRF in higher AMD severities, and its
correlation with previously associated AMD biomarkers, suggests
HRF is an important OCT feature adding to the understanding of
disease progression. Hyperreflective foci presence was
associated with delays in DA, indicating HRF is a marker for
visual cycle impairment. FINANCIAL DISCLOSURE(S): Proprietary or
