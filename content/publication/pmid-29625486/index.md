abstract: "To examine the topographic correlation between retinal morphology and retinal sensitivity by mesopic and scotopic fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in eyes with intermediate AMD. Thirty-five eyes from 32 patients (mean age 70.9 years) and 29 age-matched controls prospectively underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging. Mesopic (Goldman III, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) and scotopic (Goldman V, 200 ms, 4-2 strategy) FCP with a 56-stimulus point grid was performed in AMD patients with the MP-1S. Thickness values of different retinal layers were measured at each stimulus point and compared, topographically corresponding to values in controls of similar age for pointwise structural-functional analysis. 0.001, respectively). Accumulation of sub-RPE material in patients with intermediate AMD is spatially associated to quantifiable structural alterations in various retinal layers and to corresponding retinal dysfunction. The topographic analysis of retinal thickness and retinal sensitivity will be helpful for a better understanding of the disease process and for the evaluation of new interventional approaches."
