 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) occur in
association with various chorioretinal diseases. With respect to
the broad clinical spectrum of PEDs we describe fundus
autofluorescence (FAF) characteristics of PEDs. METHODS:
Ninety-three eyes of 66 patients (mean age 71.9 $±$ 11.1) with
uni- or bilateral PED ( $≥$ 350 µm) were included in a
retrospective cross-sectional study. PEDs were secondary to
age-related macular degeneration (n = 79), central serous
chorioretinopathy (n = 7), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n
= 2), pattern dystrophy (n = 3) or idiopathic PED (n = 2). FAF
images were recorded using confocal scanning laser
ophthalmoscopy (488 nm excitation wavelength, detection of
emission >500 nm). Diagnosis of PED was confirmed using
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A qualitative FAF
grading system was established, and grading was performed by two
independent readers. RESULTS: PEDs showed highly variable
characteristics on FAF imaging. FAF within the area of PED was
found to be irregular/granular (n = 59, 63.4%), increased (n =
28, 30.1%), decreased (n = 3, 3.2 %), or normal (n = 3,
3.2%). Accompanying FAF changes included condensation of
macular pigment (n = 67, 72.0%), focally increased FAF at the
PED apex (n = 14, 15.1%) or elsewhere (n = 52, 55.9%), focally
decreased FAF (n = 23, 24.7%), a cartwheel-like pattern (n =
10, 10.8%), a doughnut sign (n = 6, 6.5%), and a halo of
decreased FAF encircling the PED (completely n = 20, 21.5% or
incompletely n = 20, 21.5%). CONCLUSIONS: PEDs show a variety
of abnormal patterns on FAF imaging. These changes in FAF
signals may be secondary to morphological and metabolic
alterations within corresponding retinal layers and do not
necessarily correspond with the underlying PED subtype or a
specific pathology.},
