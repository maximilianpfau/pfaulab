abstract: 'BACKGROUND: Pigment epithelial detachments (PEDs) occur in association
  with various chorioretinal diseases. With respect to the broad clinical spectrum
  of PEDs we describe fundus autofluorescence (FAF) characteristics of PEDs. METHODS:
  Ninety-three eyes of 66 patients (mean age 71.9 $±$ 11.1) with uni- or bilateral
  PED ( $≥$ 350 µm) were included in a retrospective cross-sectional study. PEDs were
  secondary to age-related macular degeneration (n = 79), central serous chorioretinopathy
  (n = 7), polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (n = 2), pattern dystrophy (n = 3) or
  idiopathic PED (n = 2). FAF images were recorded using confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy
  (488 nm excitation wavelength, detection of emission >500 nm). Diagnosis of PED
  was confirmed using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. A qualitative
  FAF grading system was established, and grading was performed by two independent
  readers. RESULTS: PEDs showed highly variable characteristics on FAF imaging. FAF
  within the area of PED was found to be irregular/granular (n = 59, 63.4%), increased
  (n = 28, 30.1%), decreased (n = 3, 3.2 %), or normal (n = 3, 3.2%). Accompanying
  FAF changes included condensation of macular pigment (n = 67, 72.0%), focally increased
  FAF at the PED apex (n = 14, 15.1%) or elsewhere (n = 52, 55.9%), focally decreased
  FAF (n = 23, 24.7%), a cartwheel-like pattern (n = 10, 10.8%), a doughnut sign (n
  = 6, 6.5%), and a halo of decreased FAF encircling the PED (completely n = 20, 21.5%
  or incompletely n = 20, 21.5%). CONCLUSIONS: PEDs show a variety of abnormal patterns
  on FAF imaging. These changes in FAF signals may be secondary to morphological and
  metabolic alterations within corresponding retinal layers and do not necessarily
  correspond with the underlying PED subtype or a specific pathology.'
