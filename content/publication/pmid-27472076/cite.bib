 abstract = {We compared the area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and macular capillary network density at different retinal layers using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in normal individuals and patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR).\\ Images (a 3 Ã— 3 mm cube centered on the fovea) were acquired in 40 eyes of 22 normal individuals and 28 eyes of 18 patients with varying levels of DR using a swept-source OCT-A device (central wavelength 1050 nm; A-scan-rate of 100,000 scans per second). En face images of the retinal vasculature were generated from the superficial and deep retinal layers (SRL/DRL). Quantitative analysis of the vessel density (VD) and FAZ area was performed. Vessel density was assessed as the ratio of the retinal area occupied by vessels.\\ 0.001; DRL, P = 0.028).\\ Swept-source OCT-A of the microcirculation in eyes of patients with DR can be used to quantitatively demonstrate alterations in the FAZ and VD in the SRL/DRL of the macula compared to normal eyes. Future longitudinal studies may use these metrics to evaluate changes over time or in response to treatment.},
