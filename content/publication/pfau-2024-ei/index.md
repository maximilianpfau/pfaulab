abstract: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal-recessively inherited multisystem
  disease. Mutations in the ABCC6-gene are causative, coding for a transmembrane transporter
  mainly expressed in hepatocytes, which promotes the efflux of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP). This results in low levels of plasma inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a critical
  anti-mineralization factor. The clinical phenotype of PXE is characterized by the
  effects of elastic fiber calcification in the skin, the cardiovascular system, and
  the eyes. In the eyes, calcification of Bruch's membrane results in clinically visible
  lesions, including peau d'orange, angioid streaks, and comet tail lesions. Frequently,
  patients must be treated for secondary macular neovascularization. No effective
  therapy is available for treating the cause of PXE, but several promising approaches
  are emerging. Finding appropriate outcome measures remains a significant challenge
  for clinical trials in this slowly progressive disease. This review article provides
  an in-depth summary of the current understanding of PXE and its multi-systemic manifestations.
  The article offers a detailed overview of the ocular manifestations, including their
  morphological and functional consequences, as well as potential complications. Lastly,
  previous and future clinical trials of causative treatments for PXE are discussed.
