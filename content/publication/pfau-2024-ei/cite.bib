 abstract = {Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is an autosomal-recessively
inherited multisystem disease. Mutations in the ABCC6-gene are
causative, coding for a transmembrane transporter mainly
expressed in hepatocytes, which promotes the efflux of adenosine
triphosphate (ATP). This results in low levels of plasma
inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi), a critical anti-mineralization
factor. The clinical phenotype of PXE is characterized by the
effects of elastic fiber calcification in the skin, the
cardiovascular system, and the eyes. In the eyes, calcification
of Bruch's membrane results in clinically visible lesions,
including peau d'orange, angioid streaks, and comet tail
lesions. Frequently, patients must be treated for secondary
macular neovascularization. No effective therapy is available
for treating the cause of PXE, but several promising approaches
are emerging. Finding appropriate outcome measures remains a
significant challenge for clinical trials in this slowly
progressive disease. This review article provides an in-depth
summary of the current understanding of PXE and its
multi-systemic manifestations. The article offers a detailed
overview of the ocular manifestations, including their
morphological and functional consequences, as well as potential
complications. Lastly, previous and future clinical trials of
causative treatments for PXE are discussed.},
