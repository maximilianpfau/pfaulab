abstract: 'PURPOSE: To examine the feasibility and utility of dark-adapted two-color
  fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in patients with cuticular, reticular, and soft
  drusen, and to compare FCP data to microstructural spectral-domain optical coherence
  tomography (SD-OCT) data. METHODS: Forty-four eyes (24 eyes of 24 patients with
  drusen, age 69.4 $±$ 12.6 years; 20 normal eyes of 16 subjects, 61.7 $±$ 12.4 years)
  underwent duplicate mesopic, dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red FCP within 14°
  of the central retina (total of 12 936 threshold tests) using the Scotopic Macular
  Integrity Assessment (S-MAIA, CenterVue, Padova, Italy) device. FCP data were registered
  to SD-OCT data to obtain outer nuclear layer, inner and outer photoreceptor segment,
  and retinal pigment epithelium drusen complex (RPEDC) thickness data spatially corresponding
  to the stimulus location and area (0.43°). Structure-function correlations were
  assessed using mixed-effects models. RESULTS: Mean deviation values for eyes with
  cuticular, soft, and reticular drusen were similar for mesopic (-2.1, -3.4, and
  -3.6 dB) and dark-adapted red (-1.4, -2.6, and -3.3 dB) FCP. For the dark-adapted
  cyan FCP (0.1, -1.9, and -5.0 dB) and for the cyan-red sensitivity difference (+1.0,
  +0.5, and -2.4 dB), the mean deviation values differed significantly in dependence
  of the predominant drusen type (one-way ANOVA; p < 0.05). RPEDC thickness was associated
  with reduction of mesopic sensitivity (-0.34 dB/10 µm RPEDC thickening; p < 0.001),
  dark-adapted cyan sensitivity (-0.11 dB/10 µm RPEDC thickening; p = 0.003), and
  dark-adapted red sensitivity (-0.26 dB/10 µm RPEDC thickening; p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS:
  In contrast to mesopic FCP, dark-adapted two-color FCP allowed for meaningful differential
  testing of rod and cone function in patients with drusen indicating predominant
  cone dysfunction in eyes with cuticular drusen and predominant rod dysfunction in
  eyes with reticular drusen. RPEDC thickness was the strongest predictor of the evaluated
  SD-OCT biomarkers for point-wise sensitivity.'
