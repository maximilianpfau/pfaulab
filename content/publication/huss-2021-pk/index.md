abstract: "INTRODUCTION: For ophthalmologic research, the systematic correlation of\
  \ clinical data with data obtained from postmortem tissue donation is of great benefit.\
  \ In this respect, the establishment of an eye donation registry represents a prerequisite\
  \ for the acquisition of such data. METHODS: A total of 300 patients were interviewed\
  \ at a tertiary referral center in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire.\
  \ Binary questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions (1 = does\
  \ apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median and 25th (Q25) and 75th\
  \ (Q75) percentiles. RESULTS: The majority of patients (77.0%) would agree to donate\
  \ their eyes for research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye donation,\
  \ 60.9% of all patients only stated reasons in the category ``addressable'' (e.g.,\
  \ not enough awareness of the topic). The vast majority of patients considered it\
  \ appropriate for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of postmortem\
  \ eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1). CONCLUSION: Overall, patients had a positive\
  \ attitude towards postmortem eye donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons\
  \ given against postmortem eye donation were often related to misconceptions and\
  \ were potentially addressable. These results underline the fundamental willingness\
  \ of ophthalmological patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research\
  \ purposes."
