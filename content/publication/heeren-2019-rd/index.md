abstract: "Purpose: Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral neurodegenerative\
  \ disorder of the central macula. Previous findings indicated more functional impairment\
  \ in low light conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal dysfunction\
  \ using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (``scotopic microperimetry'').\
  \ Methods: Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study\
  \ and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength\
  \ autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity\
  \ was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm).\
  \ Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis,\
  \ the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared\
  \ at each test location and the results were aggregated to global indices. Results:\
  \ Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes\
  \ (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in\
  \ MacTel. This was more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with\
  \ MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan,\
  \ but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan\
  \ and red sensitivity with a relatively higher cyan impairment. Conclusions: Rods\
  \ might be compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies,\
  \ our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system\
  \ in very early disease stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices\
  \ seemed to reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures\
  \ for disease progression."
