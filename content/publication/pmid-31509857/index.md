abstract: "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is clinically divided into early and late stages. The term \"dry\" AMD is widely used when there are no \"exudative\" changes in the ocular fundus. There are numerous studies on the epidemiology of AMD. Most studies differentiate between early and late forms of AMD, but without further differentiation of the \"dry\" late form. In addition, different studies may employ different classifications of AMD, which inevitably leads to deviations in epidemiological data on AMD. New classification systems take into account microstructural changes that can be detected by high resolution in vivo imaging of the retina. A new consensus classification of AMD-associated atrophy will allow future studies to be conducted according to uniform definitions. hren."
