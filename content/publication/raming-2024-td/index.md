abstract: "PURPOSE: To assess the onset, treatment frequency, and visual outcome of\
  \ anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) treatment due to secondary\
  \ choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).\
  \ DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study METHODS: One-hundred six eyes of 53 patients\
  \ with PXE were analyzed. The assessment of CNV activity relied on hemorrhage visible\
  \ on funduscopy and intra- / subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT),\
  \ individually defining a shortening or extension of treatment interval. Best-corrected\
  \ visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, age at anti-VEGF therapy initiation, and BCVA-drop\
  \ events at exudation onset (worsening of BCVA of 2 or more lines) were documented.\
  \ Further, we assessed the number of injections during the first year and the total\
  \ number of injections, the time to treatment initiation of the fellow eye, and\
  \ BCVA over time. RESULTS: During a median observation period of 77 months (IQR\
  \ 49; 126) patients received a median number of 28.0 anti-VEGF-injections (IQR 9.8;\
  \ 43.5). Eight patients received no injection (median age at baseline 38.1 years),\
  \ 11 patients underwent anti-VEGF treatment in one eye (median age 47.2 years) and\
  \ 34 patients in both eyes (median age 51.8 years). The median age at the first\
  \ anti-VEGF treatment was 52.80 years (IQR 47.2-57.6). Applying Cox regression models,\
  \ the median ``survival'' time of fellow eye until treatment initiation was 16.8\
  \ months. In the group of bilateral treated patients, the median time difference\
  \ was 9.6 months (IQR 2.1- 32.4, range 0-122) The median number of injections was\
  \ 5.5 per eye in the first year of treatment (IQR 3-7) and was associated with the\
  \ total number of injections in the observation period (2.33, CI 1.22-3.44, P <\
  \ .001). A better BCVA at the last follow-up visit was associated with a better\
  \ baseline BCVA (P < .001, R2 = 0.318) and with the absence of a BCVA drop at the\
  \ onset of exudation (P = 0.035, R2 = 0.339). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study\
  \ indicate that anti-VEGF treatment is required for most PXE patients at a relatively\
  \ young age. Once treatment in one eye is initiated, the time to fellow eye treatment\
  \ is relatively short. A BCVA drop before treatment initiation is a risk factor\
  \ for worse visual outcomes, suggesting that treatment is prudent before exudation\
  \ affects the central retina. Given the young age of onset and intensive treatment\
  \ needs, patients with PXE might particularly benefit from longer-acting anti-VEGF\
  \ therapeutics."
