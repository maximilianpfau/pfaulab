 abstract = {PURPOSE: To assess the onset, treatment frequency, and visual
outcome of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF)
treatment due to secondary choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in
patients with pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE). DESIGN:
Retrospective cohort study METHODS: One-hundred six eyes of 53
patients with PXE were analyzed. The assessment of CNV activity
relied on hemorrhage visible on funduscopy and intra- /
subretinal fluid on optical coherence tomography (OCT),
individually defining a shortening or extension of treatment
interval. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at baseline, age
at anti-VEGF therapy initiation, and BCVA-drop events at
exudation onset (worsening of BCVA of 2 or more lines) were
documented. Further, we assessed the number of injections during
the first year and the total number of injections, the time to
treatment initiation of the fellow eye, and BCVA over time.
RESULTS: During a median observation period of 77 months (IQR
49; 126) patients received a median number of 28.0
anti-VEGF-injections (IQR 9.8; 43.5). Eight patients received no
injection (median age at baseline 38.1 years), 11 patients
underwent anti-VEGF treatment in one eye (median age 47.2 years)
and 34 patients in both eyes (median age 51.8 years). The median
age at the first anti-VEGF treatment was 52.80 years (IQR
47.2-57.6). Applying Cox regression models, the median
``survival'' time of fellow eye until treatment initiation was
16.8 months. In the group of bilateral treated patients, the
median time difference was 9.6 months (IQR 2.1- 32.4, range
0-122) The median number of injections was 5.5 per eye in the
first year of treatment (IQR 3-7) and was associated with the
total number of injections in the observation period (2.33, CI
1.22-3.44, P < .001). A better BCVA at the last follow-up visit
was associated with a better baseline BCVA (P < .001, R2 =
0.318) and with the absence of a BCVA drop at the onset of
exudation (P = 0.035, R2 = 0.339). CONCLUSIONS: The results of
this study indicate that anti-VEGF treatment is required for
most PXE patients at a relatively young age. Once treatment in
one eye is initiated, the time to fellow eye treatment is
relatively short. A BCVA drop before treatment initiation is a
risk factor for worse visual outcomes, suggesting that treatment
is prudent before exudation affects the central retina. Given
the young age of onset and intensive treatment needs, patients
with PXE might particularly benefit from longer-acting anti-VEGF
therapeutics.},
