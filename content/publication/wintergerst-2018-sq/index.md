abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate the involvement of the retinal and choriocapillaris
  microvasculature in intermediate uveitis on optical coherence tomography angiography
  (OCT-A). DESIGN: Case-control study. METHODS: Patients and age-matched controls
  were imaged with swept-source OCT-A. Using ImageJ, superficial and deep retinal
  vasculature were semi-automatically analyzed for vessel (VD) and skeleton density
  (SD), vessel diameter index (VDI), and fractal dimension (FD). Choriocapillaris
  layer was automatically graded for mean signal intensity, signal intensity standard
  deviation, kurtosis of signal intensity distribution, and flow signal voids. RESULTS:
  Twenty-nine intermediate uveitis eyes and 30 control eyes were included. Both superficial
  and deep retinal layers showed significant reduction in all OCT-A parameters (eg,
  superficial retinal layer: 0.31 vs 0.40 VD, 5.6e-8 vs 6.4e-8 SD, 5.4e6 vs 6.1e6
  VDI, and 1.78 vs 1.79 FD, respectively, all P < .05). At the choriocapillaris layer
  a greater heterogeneity of perfusion with a shift toward a higher proportion of
  large confluent flow signal voids was present. Also in the absence of macular edema
  OCT-A parameters were reduced when compared with healthy controls (all parameters
  except for VDI in the superficial retinal layer and the choriocapillaris kurtosis
  and flow signal void analyses). CONCLUSIONS: In intermediate uveitis, reduced vascular
  density and complexity in superficial as well as deep retinal layers and altered
  choriocapillaris perfusion are present. Moreover, these findings indicate impairment
  of the macular microvasculature even in the absence of macular edema. The results
  of our study may aid in the diagnosis as well as the monitoring of intermediate
  uveitis.'
