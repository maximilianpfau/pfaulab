abstract: 'IMPORTANCE: As a disabling and frequent disease, geographic atrophy secondary
  to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) constitutes an important study subject.
  Emerging clinical trials require suitable end points. The characterization and validation
  of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is warranted. OBJECTIVE:
  To prospectively evaluate reading performance in geographic atrophy and to assess
  its association with established visual function assessments and structural biomarkers.
  DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The noninterventional, prospective natural history
  Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with geographic
  atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the University Hospital in Bonn,
  Germany. Participants were enrolled from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began
  December 2019 and ended January 2021. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Reading acuity
  and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts. Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence
  and infrared reflectance images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic
  atrophy, followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear mixed-effects
  models were applied to investigate the association of those variables with reading
  performance. RESULTS: A total of 150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this
  study (median [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60%]; 34 men [40%]).
  Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR) monocular reading acuity of
  0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the reading acuity determination and a reading speed
  of 52.8 (0-123) words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis,
  best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central Early Treatment
  Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving
  geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the inner-right ETDRS subfield
  showed strongest associations with reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading
  acuity = 0.69). Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were best-corrected
  visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central
  ETDRS subfield, in the inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS
  subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal analysis, a similar
  prediction accuracy for reading performance was determined (R2 for reading acuity
  = 0.73; R2 for reading speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when follow-up
  time was added as an independent variable. Binocular reading performance did not
  differ from reading performance in the better-seeing eye. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE:
  The association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional and structural
  biomarkers supports the validity of reading performance as a meaningful end point
  in clinical trials. These findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision
  care for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on the better-seeing
  eye.'
