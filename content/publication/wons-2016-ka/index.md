abstract: "Purpose: The aim of the study was to visualize and to quantify pathological\
  \ foveal avascular zone (FAZ) alterations through optical coherence tomography angiography\
  \ (OCT-A) in eyes with retinal vein occlusion (RVO) in comparison to the unaffected\
  \ fellow eyes. Procedures: OCT-A was conducted with the Avanti® RTVue 100 XR system\
  \ (Optovue Inc., Fremont, Calif., USA). The borders of the superficial vascular\
  \ layer (SVL) were defined as 3 $μ$m below the internal limiting membrane and 15\
  \ $μ$m below the inner plexiform layer, and for the deep vascular layer (DVL) as\
  \ 15 and 70 $μ$m below the inner plexiform layer, respectively. The length of the\
  \ horizontal, vertical and maximum FAZ was manually measured for the SVL and DVL\
  \ in each eye. Additionally, the angle between the maximum FAZ diameter and the\
  \ papillomacular plane was measured. Results: OCT-A depicted defects within the\
  \ perifoveal vasculature in eyes with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO; n = 11)\
  \ and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO; n = 8). These resulted in an enlargement\
  \ of the maximum FAZ diameter in eyes with RVO (n = 19) in comparison to the healthy\
  \ fellow eyes (n = 19; 921 $±$ 213 vs. 724 $±$ 145 µm; p = 0.008). Furthermore,\
  \ a significant correlation was found between best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)\
  \ and the maximum FAZ diameter in the DVL (Spearman's $h̊o$ = -0.423, p"
