 abstract = {To determine the interreader agreement for incomplete retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and outer retinal atrophy (iRORA) and complete RPE and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) and their related features in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\\ Interreader agreement study.\\ Twelve readers from 6 reading centers.\\ After formal training, readers qualitatively assessed 60 OCT B-scans from 60 eyes with AMD for 9 individual features associated with early atrophy and performed 7 different annotations to quantify the spatial extent of OCT features within regions of interest. The qualitative and quantitative features were used to derive the presence of iRORA and cRORA and also in an exploratory analysis to examine if agreement could be improved using different combinations of features to define OCT atrophy.\\ ) for qualitatively graded OCT features and classification of iRORA and cRORA, and smallest real difference (SRD) for quantitatively graded OCT features.\\ = 0.68; P = 0.013).\\ Assessment of iRORA and cRORA, and most of their associated features, can be performed relatively consistently and robustly. A refined combination of features to define early atrophy could further improve interreader agreement.},
