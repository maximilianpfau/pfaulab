abstract: 'PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to quantify choriocapillaris (CC) flow
  alterations in early Sorsby fundus dystrophy (SFD) and to investigate the relationship
  of the CC flow deficits with the choroidal and outer retinal microstructure. METHODS:
  In this prospective case-control study, 18 eyes of 11 patients with early SFD and
  31 eyes of 31 controls without ocular pathology underwent multimodal imaging, including
  spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT), followed by deep-learning-based
  layer segmentation. OCT angiography (OCTA) was performed to quantify CC flow signal
  deficits (FDs). Differences in CC FD density between SFD patients and controls were
  determined, and the relationships with choroidal thickness, retinal pigment epithelium-drusen
  complex (RPEDC) thickness and outer retinal layer thicknesses were analyzed using
  mixed-model analysis. RESULTS: SFD patients exhibited a significantly greater CC
  FD density than controls (estimate [95% CI]: +20.0%FD [13.3; 26.7], p < 0.001 for
  SFD patients), even when adjusted for age. Square-root transformed choroidal thickness
  was a structural OCT surrogate of the CC FD density (-2.1%FD per $√$µm, p < 0.001),
  whereas RPEDC thickness was not informative regarding CC FD (p = 0.061). The CC
  FD density was associated with an altered microstructure of the overlying photoreceptors
  (outer segments, inner segments, and outer nuclear layer thinning of -0.19 $μ$m,
  -0.08 $μ$m and -0.30 $μ$m per %FD, respectively, all p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Patients
  with early SFD exhibit pronounced abnormalities of CC flow signal on OCTA, which
  are not limited to areas of sub-RPE deposits seen on OCT imaging. Thus, analysis
  of the CC flow may enable clinical trials at earlier disease stages in SFD.'
