 abstract = {To identify morphological characteristics preceding the development of exudative neovascularisation secondary to Macular Telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) using multimodal retinal imaging.\\ In this retrospective study, eyes with a minimum observation period of 6 months prior to the de novo diagnosis of an exudative neovascularisation secondary to MacTel were analysed. Morphological changes preceding the formation of neovascularisation were evaluated using colour fundus photography, infrared imaging, fluorescein angiography, macular pigment measurement and optical coherence tomography (OCT). OCT-angiography (OCT-A) images were additionally available in a subset of patients.\\ /month), increased thickness of the temporal parafovea and hyper-reflective lesions on OCT. The latter underwent morphological changes preceding the development of exudative neovascularisation, including an increase in size and density, and expansion to outer retinal layers and the retinal pigment epithelium. All eyes showed a foveal depletion of macular pigment. On OCT-A, a focal increase in blood flow was observed at the level of the outer retina/choriocapillaris, and retinal-retinal and retinal-choroidal anastomoses preceded the formation of exudative neovascularisation.\\ Multimodal imaging allows the identification of prognostic morphological features preceding the formation of exudative neovascularisation in MacTel. Eyes exhibiting these characteristics should be monitored closely and patients should be alert for emergent symptoms in order to detect and treat neovascularisation early and, thereby, prevent irreversible visual loss.},
