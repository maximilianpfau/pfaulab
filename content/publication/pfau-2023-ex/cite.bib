 abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare
hereditary systemic disease that results in alterations of the
kidneys, inner ear, and various structures of the eye. It is
caused by mutations in one of the genes encoding collagen type
IV. In recent years, new and innovative imaging techniques have
added characteristics of ocular alterations in AS and provided
new insights, including into the pathogenesis of the disease.
The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current
knowledge of ocular changes in AS, as well as to present the
Alport ocular pass. METHOD: Narrative review article. RESULTS:
Ocular manifestations of AS include changes in the cornea, lens,
and retina. Specifically, posterior polymorphic corneal
dystrophy, anterior lenticonus (pathognomonic for AS), and
various retinal changes have been described, which have been
further characterized in recent years by newer imaging
techniques. In particular, foveal changes in AS may present as
both a thickened central retina in the context of foveal
hypoplasia or a staircase-like thinning of the fovea. Both
lesions could provide further insights into the role of type IV
collagen in ocular structures. CONCLUSION: The AS can manifest
in various structures of the eye. The staircase-like changes of
the central retina in AS patients indicate the important role of
collagen type IV in the homeostasis and regular function of the
inner retinal layers. The often mild foveal hypoplasia may
provide clues to the role of collagen type IV in retinal
embryogenesis. While anterior lenticonus is pathognomonic for AS
and can be treated easily by refractive lens exchange, the only
option currently available for retinal alterations is close
follow-up and, if necessary, treatment of systemic complications
of AS.},
