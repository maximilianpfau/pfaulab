abstract: 'BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Alport syndrome (AS) is a rare hereditary systemic
  disease that results in alterations of the kidneys, inner ear, and various structures
  of the eye. It is caused by mutations in one of the genes encoding collagen type
  IV. In recent years, new and innovative imaging techniques have added characteristics
  of ocular alterations in AS and provided new insights, including into the pathogenesis
  of the disease. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of the current knowledge
  of ocular changes in AS, as well as to present the Alport ocular pass. METHOD: Narrative
  review article. RESULTS: Ocular manifestations of AS include changes in the cornea,
  lens, and retina. Specifically, posterior polymorphic corneal dystrophy, anterior
  lenticonus (pathognomonic for AS), and various retinal changes have been described,
  which have been further characterized in recent years by newer imaging techniques.
  In particular, foveal changes in AS may present as both a thickened central retina
  in the context of foveal hypoplasia or a staircase-like thinning of the fovea. Both
  lesions could provide further insights into the role of type IV collagen in ocular
  structures. CONCLUSION: The AS can manifest in various structures of the eye. The
  staircase-like changes of the central retina in AS patients indicate the important
  role of collagen type IV in the homeostasis and regular function of the inner retinal
  layers. The often mild foveal hypoplasia may provide clues to the role of collagen
  type IV in retinal embryogenesis. While anterior lenticonus is pathognomonic for
  AS and can be treated easily by refractive lens exchange, the only option currently
  available for retinal alterations is close follow-up and, if necessary, treatment
  of systemic complications of AS.'
