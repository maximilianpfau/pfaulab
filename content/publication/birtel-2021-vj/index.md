abstract: 'PURPOSE: To investigate multimodal retinal imaging characteristics including
  the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with RPGR-associated
  retinitis pigmentosa (RP). METHODS: This cross-sectional case-control study included
  17 consecutive patients (median age, 21 years) with RPGR-associated RP who underwent
  retinal imaging including optical coherence tomography (OCT), short-wavelength fundus
  autofluorescence (AF) imaging, and RNFL scans centered on the optic disc. RNFL thickness
  was manually segmented and compared to clinical and imaging parameters including
  the transfoveal ellipsoid zone (EZ) width, the horizontal diameter of the macular
  hyperautofluorescent ring. RNFL thickness was compared to 17 age- and sex-matched
  controls. RESULTS: In patients with RPGR-associated RP, the EZ width (R2 = 0.65),
  the central hyperautofluorescent ring on AF images (R2 = 0.72), and visual acuity
  (R2 = 0.68) were negatively correlated with age. In comparison to controls, a significantly
  (p < 0.0001) increased global RNFL thickness was identified in RPGR-associated RP,
  which was, however, less pronounced in progressed disease as indicated by the EZ
  width or the diameter of the central hyperautofluorescent ring. CONCLUSIONS: This
  study describes retinal characteristics in patients with RPGR-associated RP including
  a pronounced peripapillary RNFL thickness compared to healthy controls. These results
  contribute to the knowledge about imaging biomarkers in RP, which might be of interest
  for therapeutic approaches such as gene replacement therapies.'
