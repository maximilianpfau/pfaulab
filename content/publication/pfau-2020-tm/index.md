abstract: "PURPOSE: To investigate the association between the presence of type 1\
  \ choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the localized progression of atrophy in\
  \ age-related macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Analysis of patients' data collected\
  \ in the context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at the Department\
  \ of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 98 eyes\
  \ diagnosed with AMD of 59 patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean ($±$standard\
  \ deviation) age at baseline of 76.60$±$6.65 years and median (interquartile range)\
  \ review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55) were included. Eyes were subdivided into\
  \ 3 categories based on multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment epithelium\
  \ (RPE) atrophy with treatment-naı̈ve quiescent CNV (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history\
  \ of exudative CNV (n=10), and RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81).\
  \ METHODS: Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis of serial\
  \ fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance images. If CNV was detected by\
  \ OCT angiography (OCTA), its location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE\
  \ atrophy. The localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to the\
  \ CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression. The spatial\
  \ overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression\
  \ was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Odds ratio\
  \ (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying type 1 CNV. RESULTS:\
  \ The prediction model achieved a high overlap between predicted and observed RPE\
  \ atrophy progression with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95% confidence\
  \ interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds for future RPE\
  \ atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the\
  \ presence of treatment-näve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of 0.46 (95%\
  \ CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1 CNV. CONCLUSIONS: The results\
  \ indicate that there is markedly reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing\
  \ with quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is compatible with a\
  \ potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on the RPE and overlying neurosensory\
  \ retina. These results may have relevant clinical implications for the management\
  \ of CNV and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy progression."
