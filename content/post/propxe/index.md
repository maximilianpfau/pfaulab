For the natural history study **PRO-PXE** (Progression Rate of Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum-associated Choroidal and Retinal Degeneration), the Eye Clinic of the University Hospital Basel is currently recruiting volunteers with PXE.

# Purpose of the study
This study aims to systematically compare new visual function tests and new ophthalmic imaging techniques to monitor the natural history of pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).

Currently, several drugs are evaluated in trials for treating PXE. These trials often monitor patients using computed tomography (CT) imaging of the arteries. However, ophthalmic examination methods that allow direct functional testing and imaging of nerve tissue may be better suited to document early disease progression. Whether this is indeed the case will now be investigated.

# Participation requirements

### Inclusion criteria:
* Diagnosis of Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE)
* Age of 18 years or older

### Exclusion criteria:
* Fear of confined spaces (claustrophobia, exclusion criterion due to dark-adapted testing)

### Scope
Total duration: 24 months

The study includes a baseline visit (month 0), a month 2 (retest) visit, a month 12 visit, and a month 24 visit.

Each visit takes about 4 to 5 hours (with small breaks).

### Risks
No health risks are to be expected.

### Benefits
With the help of the collected data, it may be possible to examine possible treatment effects of upcoming therapeutics more precisely. Therefore, PXE patients are expected to benefit from the collected data in the future.

The study includes a comprehensive battery of ophthalmologic examinations. Under certain circumstances, lesions requiring therapy might be detected early.

However, it is possible that you will not derive any personal benefit from participating in the study.
