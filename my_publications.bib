   Abstract={Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of irreversible vision loss among individuals older than 50 years. Although considerable advances have been made in our understanding of AMD genetics, the differential effects of major associated loci on disease manifestation and progression may not be well characterized.\\ To elucidate the specific associations of the 2 most common genetic risk loci for AMD, the CFH-CFHR5 locus on chromosome 1q32 (Chr1) and the ARMS2/HTRA1 locus on chromosome 10q26 (Chr10)-independent of one another and in combination-with time to conversion to late-stage disease and to visual acuity loss.\\ 10-risk) or at either Chr1 (Chr1-risk) or Chr10 (Chr10-risk) and who had enrolled in Genetic and Molecular Studies of Eye Diseases at the Sharon Eccles Steele Center for Translational Medicine between September 2009 and March 2020.

These genotype-phenotype associations may warrant consideration when designing and interpreting AMD research studies and clinical trials.},

   Abstract={BACKGROUNDOutcome measures sensitive to disease progression are needed for ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 4-associated (ABCA4-associated) retinopathy. We aimed to quantify ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss and photoreceptor degeneration beyond EZ-loss in ABCA4-associated retinopathy and investigate associations between photoreceptor degeneration, genotype, and age.METHODSWe analyzed 132 eyes from 66 patients (of 67 enrolled) with molecularly confirmed ABCA4-associated retinopathy from a prospective natural history study with a median [IQR] follow-up of 4.2 years [3.1, 5.1]. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volume scans (37 B-scans, 30° × 15°) were segmented using a deep learning (DL) approach. For genotype-phenotype analysis, a model of ABCA4 variants was applied with the age of criterion EZ-loss (6.25 mm2) as the dependent variable.RESULTSPatients exhibited an average (square-root-transformed) EZ-loss progression rate of [95% CI] 0.09 mm/y [0.06, 0.11]. Outer nuclear layer (ONL) thinning extended beyond the area of EZ-loss. The average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to normalization of ONL thickness (to ±2 z score units) was 3.20° [2.53, 3.87]. Inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thinning was less pronounced, with an average distance from the EZ-loss boundary to layer thickness normalization of 1.20° [0.91, 1.48] for the IS and 0.60° [0.49, 0.72] for the OS. An additive model of allele severity explained 52.7% of variability in the age of criterion EZ-loss.CONCLUSIONPatients with ABCA4-associated retinopathy exhibited significant alterations of photoreceptors outside of EZ-loss. DL-based analysis of photoreceptor laminae may help monitor disease progression and estimate the severity of ABCA4 variants.TRIAL REGISTRATIONClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01736293.FUNDINGNational Eye Institute Intramural Research Program and German Research Foundation grant PF950/1-1.},

   Abstract={For many inherited and acquired retinal diseases, reduced night vision is a primary symptom. Despite this, the clinical testing options for spatially resolved scotopic vision have until recently been limited. Scotopic microperimetry is a relatively new visual function test that combines two-colour perimetry with fundus-controlled perimetry performed in scotopic luminance conditions. The technique enables spatially resolved mapping of central retinal sensitivity alongside the ability to distinguish between rod and cone photoreceptor sensitivities. Two companies produce commercially available scotopic microperimeters - Nidek (Nidek Technologies Srl, Padova, Italy) and CenterVue (CenterVue S.p.A., Padova, Italy). Scotopic microperimetry is a promising technology capable of detecting changes in retinal sensitivity before changes in other measures of visual function. Scotopic microperimetry is a promising functional biomarker that has the potential as a useful clinical trial outcome measure. This review summarises the evolution and applications of scotopic microperimetry, and discusses testing options, including testing grid selection, dark-adaptation time and threshold sensitivity analyses.},

A custom deep-learning-based segmentation algorithm was trained and validated to quantify the retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) and ganglion cell layer (GCL).

Including the number of intravitreal injections did not improve the model fit. The RNFL thickness was not significantly associated with any of these parameters.\\ This study demonstrates a significant association of ageing and ONHD with GCL thinning in patients with PXE, but not with the number of anti-VEGF injections. Given the severity of inner retinal degeneration in PXE, a clinical trial investigating neuroprotective therapy warrants consideration.},

   Abstract={Refined understanding of the association of retinal microstructure with current and future (post-treatment) function in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) may help to identify patients that would benefit most from treatment. In this post-hoc analysis of data from the prospective, randomized PLACE trial (NCT01797861), we aimed to determine the accuracy of AI-based inference of retinal function from retinal morphology in cCSC. Longitudinal spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) data from 57 eyes of 57 patients from baseline, week 6-8 and month 7-8 post-treatment were segmented using deep-learning software. Fundus-controlled perimetry data were aligned to the SD-OCT data to extract layer thickness and reflectivity values for each test point. Point-wise retinal sensitivity could be inferred with a (leave-one-out) cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) [95% CI] of 2.93 dB [2.40-3.46] (scenario 1) using random forest regression. With addition of patient-specific baseline data (scenario 2), retinal sensitivity at remaining follow-up visits was estimated even more accurately with a MAE of 1.07 dB [1.06-1.08]. In scenario 3, month 7-8 post-treatment retinal sensitivity was predicted from baseline SD-OCT data with a MAE of 3.38 dB [2.82-3.94]. Our study shows that localized retinal sensitivity can be inferred from retinal structure in cCSC using machine-learning. Especially, prediction of month 7-8 post-treatment sensitivity with consideration of the treatment as explanatory variable constitutes an important step toward personalized treatment decisions in cCSC.},

Emerging clinical trials require suitable end points. The characterization and validation of reading performance as a functional outcome parameter is warranted.\\ To prospectively evaluate reading performance in geographic atrophy and to assess its association with established visual function assessments and structural biomarkers.\\ The noninterventional, prospective natural history Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy study included patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD who were recruited at the University Hospital in Bonn, Germany. Participants were enrolled from June 2013 to June 2016. Analysis began December 2019 and ended January 2021.\\ Reading acuity and reading speed were assessed using Radner charts. Longitudinal fundus autofluorescence and infrared reflectance images were semiautomatically annotated for geographic atrophy, followed by extraction of shape-descriptive variables. Linear mixed-effects models were applied to investigate the association of those variables with reading performance.\\ A total of 150 eyes of 85 participants were included in this study (median [IQR] age, 77.9 [72.4-82.1] years; 51 women [60%]; 34 men [40%]). Reading performance was impaired with a median (IQR) monocular reading acuity of 0.9 (0.4-1.3) logarithm of the reading acuity determination and a reading speed of 52.8 (0-123) words per minute. In the multivariable cross-sectional analysis, best-corrected visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) subfield, classification of noncenter vs center-involving geographic atrophy, and area of geographic atrophy in the inner-right ETDRS subfield showed strongest associations with reading acuity (cross-validated R2for reading acuity = 0.69). Regarding reading speed, the most relevant variables were best-corrected visual acuity, low-luminance visual acuity, area of geographic atrophy in the central ETDRS subfield, in the inner-right ETDRS subfield, and in the inner-upper ETDRS subfield (R2 for reading speed = 0.67). In the longitudinal analysis, a similar prediction accuracy for reading performance was determined (R2 for reading acuity = 0.73; R2 for reading speed = 0.70). Prediction accuracy did not improve when follow-up time was added as an independent variable. Binocular reading performance did not differ from reading performance in the better-seeing eye.\\ The association of reading acuity and speed with visual functional and structural biomarkers supports the validity of reading performance as a meaningful end point in clinical trials. These findings suggest that measures in clinical and low-vision care for patients with geographic atrophy should focus primarily on the better-seeing eye.},

To capture nonlinear progression in a flexible way, we systematically assess Box-Cox transformations with different transformation parameters λ. Model evaluation is performed on data collected for two longitudinal, prospective multi-center cohort studies on GA size progression.\\ A transformation parameter of λ=0.45 yielded the best model fit regarding the Akaike information criterion (AIC). When hypertension and hypercholesterolemia were included as risk factors in the model, they showed an association with progression of GA size. The mean estimated age-of-onset in this model was 67.21±6.49 years.\\ We provide a comprehensive framework for modeling the course of uni- or bilateral GA size progression in longitudinal observational studies. Specifically, the model allows for age-of-onset estimation, identification of risk factors and prediction of future GA size.

Probabilistic forecasting was performed using natural gradient boosting (NGBoost), which outputs a full probability distribution. The mean absolute error (MAE) between the predicted versus actual anti-VEGF treatment frequency was the primary outcome measure.\\ In a total of 138 visits of 99 eyes with neovascular AMD (96 patients) from two clinical centers, the prediction of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency was observed with an accuracy (MAE [95% confidence interval]) of 2.60 injections/year [2.25-2.96] (R2 = 0.390) using random forest regression and 2.66 injections/year [2.31-3.01] (R2 = 0.094) using NGBoost, respectively. Prediction intervals were well calibrated and reflected the true uncertainty of NGBoost-based predictions. Standard deviation of RPEDC-thickness in the central ETDRS-subfield constituted an important predictor across models.\\ The proposed, fully automated pipeline enables probabilistic forecasting of future anti-VEGF treatment frequency in real-world settings.\\ Prediction of a probability distribution allows the physician to inspect the underlying uncertainty. Predictive uncertainty estimates are essential to highlight cases where human-inspection and/or reversion to a fallback alternative is warranted.},

   Abstract={Sensitive and robust outcome measures of retinal function are pivotal for clinical trials in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). A recent development is the implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer results of psychophysical examinations based on findings derived from multimodal imaging. We conducted a review of the current literature referenced in PubMed and Web of Science among others with the keywords 'artificial intelligence' and 'machine learning' in combination with 'perimetry', 'best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)', 'retinal function' and 'age-related macular degeneration'. So far AI-based structure-function correlations have been applied to infer conventional visual field, fundus-controlled perimetry, and electroretinography data, as well as BCVA, and patient-reported outcome measures (PROM). In neovascular AMD, inference of BCVA (hereafter termed inferred BCVA) can estimate BCVA results with a root mean squared error of ~7-11 letters, which is comparable to the accuracy of actual visual acuity assessment. Further, AI-based structure-function correlation can successfully infer fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) results both for mesopic as well as dark-adapted (DA) cyan and red testing (hereafter termed inferred sensitivity). Accuracy of inferred sensitivity can be augmented by adding short FCP examinations and reach mean absolute errors (MAE) of ~3-5 dB for mesopic, DA cyan and DA red testing. Inferred BCVA, and inferred retinal sensitivity, based on multimodal imaging, may be considered as a quasi-functional surrogate endpoint for future interventional clinical trials in the future.\\ 摘要: 对于年龄相关性黄斑变性(AMD)的临床试验来说, 敏感且强大的视网膜功能测量手段是至关重要的。近期的新进展是利用人工智能(AI)来解释多模式影像成像的心理物理检查结果。我们以“人工智能”和“机器学习”为关键词, 结合“视野测量”、“最佳矫正视力(BCVA)”、“视网膜功能”和“年龄相关性黄斑变性”, 对PubMed和Web of Science中的文献进行了综述。到目前为止, 基于人工智能的结构功能相关性的研究已被应用于传统的视野检查、FCP视野检查、视网膜电生理检查以及BCVA的检查和患者报告结果(PROM)的测量。对于新生血管性AMD, BCVA推理法(以下称为BCVA推测法)可以评估BCVA结果, 其均方根误差大约为7-11个字母, 这与实际视力评估的准确性相当。此外, 基于人工智能的结构功能相关性的研究可以成功推测FCP视野检查的结果, 包括中间视觉、暗适应(DA)青色和红色试验(以下称为灵敏度推测法)。通过增加短时间的FCP检查, 可以提高灵敏度推测法的准确性, 对于中间视觉法、暗适应青色法和暗适应红色法, 其平均绝对误差(MAE)约为3-5 dB。基于多模态成像的BCVA推测法和视网膜灵敏度推测法, 可被认为是未来干预性临床试验的功能评估手段的替代终点。.},

   Abstract={For ophthalmologic research, the systematic correlation of clinical data with data obtained from postmortem tissue donation is of great benefit. In this respect, the establishment of an eye donation registry represents a prerequisite for the acquisition of such data.\\ A total of 300 patients were interviewed at a tertiary referral center in Germany by means of a standardized questionnaire. Binary questions were evaluated by percentage; Likert-scaled questions (1 = does apply; 5 = does not apply) were analyzed by the median and 25th (Q25) and 75th (Q75) percentiles.\\ The majority of patients (77.0%) would agree to donate their eyes for research purposes. When asked about reasons against an eye donation, 60.9% of all patients only stated reasons in the category "addressable" (e.g., not enough awareness of the topic). The vast majority of patients considered it appropriate for an ophthalmologist to approach them on the issue of postmortem eye donation (median 1, Q25 1, Q75 1).\\ Overall, patients had a positive attitude towards postmortem eye donation for research purposes. Importantly, reasons given against postmortem eye donation were often related to misconceptions and were potentially addressable. These results underline the fundamental willingness of ophthalmological patients in Germany to donate their eyes postmortem for research purposes.},

Lesion area, perimeter, circularity, caliper diameters, and focality of areas with definitely decreased autofluorescence were determined. A model was used to predict the lesion enlargement rate based on baseline variables. Sample size calculations were performed to model the power in a simulated interventional study.\\ Sixty-eight eyes of 37 patients (age range, 14-78 years) with a follow-up time of 10 to 100 months were included. The mean annual progression of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was 0.89 mm. The number of atrophic areas, the retina-wide functional impairment, and the age-of-onset category constituted significant predictors for future retinal pigment epithelium atrophy growth, explaining 25.7% of the variability. By extension of a simulated study length and/or specific patient preselection based on these baseline characteristics, the required sample size could significantly be reduced.\\ Trial design based on specific shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics and the adaption of the trial duration may provide potential benefits in required cohort size and absolute number of visits.},

   Abstract={Correlates for Bruch membrane alterations are needed for interventional trials targeting the Bruch membrane in pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE).\\ To quantify mesopic and scotopic light sensitivity and identify its microstructural correlates associated with a diseased Bruch membrane in patients with PXE.\\ A prospective, single-center, cross-sectional case-control study was conducted at a tertiary referral center from January 31, 2018, to February 20, 2020. Twenty-two eyes of 22 patients with PXE and 40 eyes of 40 healthy individuals were included. Data analysis was completed March 15, 2020.\\ Mesopic and dark-adapted 2-color fundus-controlled perimetry (microperimetry) and multimodal retinal imaging including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and OCT angiography were performed. Perimetry thresholds were analyzed using mixed models, and structure-function correlation with SD-OCT data was performed using machine learning.\\ Observed dark-adapted cyan sensitivity loss as measure of rod photoreceptor dysfunction, as well as mean absolute error between predicted and observed retinal sensitivity to assess the accuracy of structure-function correlation.\\ Of the 22 patients with PXE included in this study, 15 were women (68%); median age was 56.5 years (interquartile range, 50.4-61.2). These patients exhibited mesopic (estimate, 5.13 dB; 95% CI, 2.89-7.38 dB), dark-adapted cyan (estimate, 9.08 dB; 95% CI, 6.34-11.82 dB), and dark-adapted red (estimate, 7.05 dB; 95% CI, 4.83-9.27 dB) sensitivity losses. This sensitivity loss was also evident in 9 eyes with nonneovascular PXE (mesopic: estimate, 3.21 dB; 95% CI, 1.28-5.14 dB; dark-adapted cyan: 5.93 dB; 95% CI, 3.59-8.27 dB; and dark-adapted red testing: 4.84 dB; 95% CI, 2.88-6.80 dB), showing a distinct centrifugal pattern of sensitivity loss with preserved function toward the periphery. Retinal function could be predicted from microstructure with high accuracy (mean absolute errors, of 4.91 dB for mesopic, 5.44 dB for dark-adapted cyan, and 4.99 dB for dark-adapted red). The machine learning-based analysis highlighted an association of a thinned inner retina and putative separation of the pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor complex with sensitivity loss.\\ In this study, among 22 patients with PXE, those with and without choroidal neovascularization exhibited reductions of retinal sensitivity being most pronounced in dark-adapted cyan testing. This finding suggests that pathologic characteristics of this Bruch membrane disease may be dominated by rod photoreceptor degeneration and/or dysfunction. A putative pigment-epithelium-photoreceptor separation may further impair rod function, while inner retinal abnormalities appear to be correlated with overall dysfunction.},

   Abstract={Fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called 'microperimetry') allows for spatially-resolved mapping of visual sensitivity and measurement of fixation stability, both in clinical practice as well as research. The accurate spatial characterization of visual function enabled by FCP can provide insightful information about disease severity and progression not reflected by best-corrected visual acuity in a large range of disorders. This is especially important for monitoring of retinal diseases that initially spare the central retina in earlier disease stages. Improved intra- and inter-session retest-variability through fundus-tracking and precise point-wise follow-up examinations even in patients with unstable fixation represent key advantages of these technique. The design of disease-specific test patterns and protocols reduces the burden of extensive and time-consuming FCP testing, permitting a more meaningful and focused application. Recent developments also allow for photoreceptor-specific testing through implementation of dark-adapted chromatic and photopic testing. A detailed understanding of the variety of available devices and test settings is a key prerequisite for the design and optimization of FCP protocols in future natural history studies and clinical trials. Accordingly, this review describes the theoretical and technical background of FCP, its prior application in clinical and research settings, data that qualify the application of FCP as an outcome measure in clinical trials as well as ongoing and future developments.},

   Abstract={Empirical models have been an integral part of everyday clinical practice in ophthalmology since the introduction of the Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) formula. Recent developments in the field of statistical learning (artificial intelligence, AI) now enable an empirical approach to a wide range of ophthalmological questions with an unprecedented precision.\\ Which criteria must be considered for the evaluation of AI-related studies in ophthalmology?\\ Exemplary prediction of visual acuity (continuous outcome) and classification of healthy and diseased eyes (discrete outcome) using retrospectively compiled optical coherence tomography data (50 eyes of 50 patients, 50 healthy eyes of 50 subjects). The data were analyzed with nested cross-validation (for learning algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization).\\ Based on nested cross-validation for training, visual acuity could be predicted in the separate test data-set with a mean absolute error (MAE, 95% confidence interval, CI of 0.142 LogMAR [0.077; 0.207]). Healthy versus diseased eyes could be classified in the test data-set with an agreement of 0.92 (Cohen's kappa). The exemplary incorrect learning algorithm and variable selection resulted in an MAE for visual acuity prediction of 0.229 LogMAR [0.150; 0.309] for the test data-set. The drastic overfitting became obvious on comparison of the MAE with the null model MAE (0.235 LogMAR [0.148; 0.322]).\\ Selection of an unsuitable measure of the goodness-of-fit, inadequate validation, or withholding of a null or reference model can obscure the actual goodness-of-fit of AI models. The illustrated pitfalls can help clinicians to identify such shortcomings.\\ HINTERGRUND: Empirische Modelle sind seit Einführung der SRK(Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff)-Formel im klinischen Alltag der Augenheilkunde etabliert. Rezente Entwicklungen im Bereich des statistischen Lernens („künstliche Intelligenz“ [KI]) ermöglichen jetzt ein empirisches Vorgehen für vielfältigste ophthalmologische Fragestellungen bei bislang unerreichter Präzision.\\ Welche Kriterien müssen für die Bewertung von Arbeiten zum Thema KI in der Augenheilkunde berücksichtigt werden?\\ Es erfolgen die beispielhafte Vorhersage des Visus (stetige Zielgröße) und Klassifikation von gesunden und kranken Augen (diskrete Zielgröße) anhand von retrospektiven optischen Kohärenztomographiebilddaten (50 Augen von 50 Patienten, 50 gesunde Augen von 50 Probanden).

Kranke und gesunde Augen ließen sich im Testdatensatz mit einer Konkordanz von (Kappa nach Cohen) 0,92 klassifizieren. Die beispielhafte inkorrekte Lernalgorithmus- und Variablenauswahl resultierte in einem MAE von 0,229 LogMAR [0,150; 0,309] für den Testdatensatz. Erst durch Vergleich mit dem MAE des Nullmodells (0,235 LogMAR [0,148; 0,322]) wurde die Überanpassung offensichtlich.\\ Die Auswahl einer ungeeigneten Kennzahl für die Anpassungsgüte, inadäquate Validierung oder Unterschlagen eines Null- oder Referenzmodells kann die tatsächliche Anpassungsgüte von KI-Modellen verschleiern. Die illustrierten Fallstricke können Klinikern und Forschern helfen, solche Unzulänglichkeiten zu erkennen.},

The ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss-to-GA boundary distance and OS thickness were prognostic for future progression rates. Outer nuclear layer and IS thinning over time was significant even when adjusting for age and proximity to the GA boundary (estimates of -0.16 μm/y; 95% CI, -0.30 to -0.02; and -0.17 μm/y; 95% CI, -0.26 to -0.09).\\ Distinct and progressive alterations of photoreceptor laminae (exceeding GA spatially) were detectable and quantifiable. The degree of photoreceptor degeneration outside of regions of retinal pigment epithelium atrophy varied markedly between eyes and was associated with future GA progression. Macula-wide photoreceptor laminae thinning represents a potential candidate end point to monitor treatment effects beyond mere GA lesion size progression.},

Decrease of scotopic and mesopic sensitivity over three years was more pronounced in areas with existing (-3.51 and -7.76 dB) and new occurring RPD (-2.06 and -5.97 dB). Structure-function analysis revealed that 1 SD decrease of pORL thickness was associated with a sensitivity reduction of 3.47 dB in scotopic and 0.79 dB in mesopic testing.\\ This study demonstrates progressive outer retinal degeneration and impairment of photoreceptor function in eyes with iAMD and RPD over three years. Preservation of outer retinal thickness and reduction of RPD formation may constitute meaningful surrogate endpoints in interventional trials on eyes with AMD and RPD aiming to slow outer retinal degeneration.},

   Abstract={Geographic atrophy (GA) represents the non-exudative late stage of age-related macular degeneration and constitutes a leading cause of legal blindness in the developed world. It is characterized by areas of loss of outer retinal layers including photoreceptors, degeneration of the retinal pigment epithelium, and rarefication of the choriocapillaris. As all three layers are functionally connected, the precise temporal sequence and relative contribution of these layers towards the development and progression of GA is unclear. The advent of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) has allowed for three-dimensional visualization of retinal blood flow. Using OCT-A, recent studies have demonstrated that choriocapillaris flow alterations are particularly associated with the development of GA, exceed atrophy boundaries spatially, and are a prognostic factor for future GA progression. Furthermore, OCT-A may be helpful to differentiate GA from mimicking diseases. Evidence for a potential protective effect of specific forms of choroidal neovascularization in the context of GA has been reported. This article aims to give a comprehensive review of the current literature concerning the application of OCT-A in GA, and summarizes the opportunities and limitations with regard to pathophysiologic considerations, differential diagnosis, study design, and patient assessment.},

   Abstract={Fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging is an in vivo imaging method that allows for topographic mapping of naturally or pathologically occurring intrinsic fluorophores of the ocular fundus. The dominant sources are fluorophores accumulating as lipofuscin in lysosomal storage bodies in postmitotic retinal pigment epithelium cells as well as other fluorophores that may occur with disease in the outer retina and subretinal space. Photopigments of the photoreceptor outer segments as well as macular pigment and melanin at the fovea and parafovea may act as filters of the excitation light. FAF imaging has been shown to be useful with regard to understanding of pathophysiological mechanisms, diagnostics, phenotype-genotype correlation, identification of prognostic markers for disease progression, and novel outcome parameters to assess efficacy of interventional strategies in chorio-retinal diseases. More recently, the spectrum of FAF imaging has been expanded with increasing use of green in addition to blue FAF, introduction of spectrally-resolved FAF, near-infrared FAF, quantitative FAF imaging and fluorescence life time imaging (FLIO). This article gives an overview of basic principles, FAF findings in various retinal diseases and an update on recent developments.},

   Abstract={-related retinopathy"). These functional tests may serve as a performance-outcome-measure (PerfO) in emerging interventional clinical trials, but utility is limited by variability and patient burden. To address these limitations, an ensemble machine-learning-based approach was evaluated to differentiate patients from controls, and predict disease categories depending on ERG ('inferred ERG') and visual impairment ('inferred visual impairment') as well as BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') based on microstructural imaging (utilizing spectral-domain optical coherence tomography) and patient data. The accuracy for 'inferred ERG' and 'inferred visual impairment' was up to 99.53 ± 1.02%. Prediction of BCVA values ('inferred BCVA') achieved a precision of ±0.3LogMAR in up to 85.31% of eyes. Analysis of the permutation importance revealed that foveal status was the most important feature for BCVA prediction, while the thickness of outer nuclear layer and photoreceptor inner and outer segments as well as age of onset highly ranked for all predictions. 'Inferred ERG', 'inferred visual impairment', and 'inferred BCVA', herein, represent accurate estimates of differential functional effects of retinal microstructure, and offer quasi-functional parameters with the potential for a refined patient assessment, and investigation of potential future treatment effects or disease progression.},

Normalized grey values at 9° to 11° eccentricity from the fovea were averaged to provide a summary measure of qAF values (termed qAF8).\\ In a multivariable model, qAF8 measurements were not significantly different between age-related macular degeneration eyes with large drusen and healthy eyes (P = 0.130), and qAF8 measurements showed a decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration eyes (P = 0.013).\\ These findings add to the body of evidence that qAF levels are not increased in eyes with large drusen compared with healthy eyes, and qAF levels show a significant decline over time in the age-related macular degeneration eyes. These findings highlight how the relationship between qAF levels and retinal pigment epithelium health does not seem to be straightforward. Further investigation is required to better understand this relationship, especially if qAF levels are to be used as an outcome measure in intervention trials.},

The concurrent validity of mesopic FCP testing using the MAIA device (CenterVue, Italy), the retest variability and its determinants, and the progression of sensitivity loss over time were investigated using mixed-model analyses. The main outcomes were the average pointwise sensitivity loss in dependence of patients' demographic, functional and imaging characteristics, the intrasession 95% coefficient of repeatability, and the pointwise sensitivity loss over time.\\ Pointwise sensitivity loss was on average (estimate (95% CI)) 13.88 dB (12.55 to 15.21) along the horizontal meridian and was significantly associated with the electrophysiological subgroup, presence/absence of foveal sparing, best-corrected visual acuity and disease duration. The 95% coefficient of repeatability was 12.15 dB (10.78 to 13.38) and varied in dependence of the underlying mean sensitivity and local sensitivity slope. The global progression rate for the sensitivity loss was 0.45 dB/year (0.13 to 0.78) and was higher for the central and inner ETDRS subfields compared with more peripheral regions.\\ Mesopic light sensitivity measured by FCP is reliable and susceptible for functional changes. It constitutes a potential clinical outcome for both natural history studies as well as future interventional studies in patients with STGD1.},

Layer thicknesses and intensities and FAF and IR intensities were extracted for each test point. The cross-validated mean absolute error (MAE) was evaluated for random forest-based predictions of retinal sensitivity with and without patient-specific training data and percentage of increased mean-squared error (%IncMSE) as measurement of feature importance.\\ Retinal sensitivity was predicted with a MAE of 4.64 dB for mesopic, 4.89 dB for DA cyan, and 4.40 dB for DA red testing in the absence of patient-specific data. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data to the training sets decreased the MAE to 2.89 dB, 2.86 dB, and 2.77 dB. For all 3 types of testing, the outer nuclear layer thickness constituted the most important predictive feature (35.0, 42.22, and 53.74 %IncMSE). Spatially resolved mapping of "inferred sensitivity" revealed regions with differential degrees of mesopic and DA cyan sensitivity loss outside of the GA lesions.\\ "Inferred sensitivity" accurately reflected retinal function in patients with GA. Mapping of "inferred sensitivity" could facilitate monitoring of disease progression and serve as "quasi functional" surrogate outcome in clinical trials, especially in consideration of retinal regions beyond areas of GA.},

The fovea was preserved in the majority of patients during the observation time. In the case of foveal involvement, the loss of visual acuity lagged behind central RPE atrophy in AF images. Sex, age, and number of atrophic foci predicted future progression rates with a cross-validated mean absolute error of 0.13 mm/year and to reduce the required sample size for simulated interventional trials.\\ Progressive RPE atrophy could be traced in all eyes using AF imaging. Shape-descriptive factors and patients' baseline characteristics had significant prognostic value, guiding appropriate subject selection and sample size in future interventional trial design.},

   Abstract={To investigate the association between the presence of type 1 choroidal neovascularization (CNV) and the localized progression of atrophy in age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\\ Analysis of patients' data collected in the context of 2 noninterventional, prospective studies conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, University of Bonn, Germany.\\ A total of 98 eyes diagnosed with AMD of 59 patients (40 female, 19 male) with a mean (±standard deviation) age at baseline of 76.60±6.65 years and median (interquartile range) review period of 1.17 years (1.01-1.55) were included. Eyes were subdivided into 3 categories based on multimodal imaging and ocular history: retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy with treatment-naïve quiescent CNV (n=7), RPE atrophy with a history of exudative CNV (n=10), and RPE atrophy without evidence of coexisting CNV (n=81).\\ Retinal pigment epithelium atrophy was delineated on the basis of serial fundus-autofluorescence and infrared-reflectance images. If CNV was detected by OCT angiography (OCTA), its location and dimension were spatially mapped to RPE atrophy. The localized progression of RPE atrophy in topographic relation to the CNV lesion was then analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression. The spatial overlap (Dice coefficient) between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression was evaluated to estimate the model accuracy.\\ Odds ratio (OR) for localized RPE atrophy progression in areas overlying type 1 CNV.\\ The prediction model achieved a high overlap between predicted and observed RPE atrophy progression with a cross-validated Dice coefficient of 0.87 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.85-0.89) reflecting a high accuracy. The odds for future RPE atrophy involvement were reduced by a factor of 0.21 (95% CI, 0.19-0.24) in the presence of treatment-naïve quiescent type 1 CNV and by a factor of 0.46 (95% CI, 0.41-0.51) in the presence of exudative type 1 CNV.\\ The results indicate that there is markedly reduced RPE atrophy progression in areas co-localizing with quiescent and exudative type 1 CNV. This observation is compatible with a potential protective effect of type 1 CNV on the RPE and overlying neurosensory retina. These results may have relevant clinical implications for the management of CNV and lead to new therapeutic strategies to prevent atrophy progression.},

Scotopic testing was performed using a 2.0 log unit neutral density filter following 30 minutes of dark adaptation. All subjects underwent complete ophthalmic examinations, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, fundus autofluorescence, infrared reflectance imaging, and flash color fundus photography. Certified graders at Doheny Image Reading Center identified subjects with evidence of AMD as defined by the Beckman classification and quantified drusen volume. RS in subjects with and without AMD was compared. Correlations between RS and drusen burden were analyzed. Ten eyes with incomplete MP-1S exams were excluded from the final analysis.\\ Among the 138 eyes from 77 subjects included in the final analysis, 42 eyes from 29 subjects had evidence of early or intermediate AMD. The mean age of subjects with AMD was 69.65 years ± 13.81 years versus 63.04 years ± 12.69 years in those without AMD (P = .06). Mesopic RS was 18.8 dB ± 2.1 dB in subjects with AMD and 19.6 dB ± 1.4 dB in those without AMD (P = .07). Scotopic RS was significantly lower (P = .04) in subjects with AMD (15.9 dB ± 2.9 dB) compared with those without AMD (17.3 dB ± 2.4 dB). There was no relationship between mesopic RS and either drusen area (r = -0.06; P = .32) or drusen volume (r = -0.08; P = .30). There was a trend for an association between scotopic RS and both drusen area (r = -0.39; P = .24) and drusen volume (r = -0.36; P = .30).\\ In an elderly Amish population, eyes with early or intermediate AMD show a greater reduction in scotopic RS than mesopic RS, suggesting that rod function is more severely affected than cone function.

   Abstract={Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is clinically divided into early and late stages. The term "dry" AMD is widely used when there are no "exudative" changes in the ocular fundus. There are numerous studies on the epidemiology of AMD. Most studies differentiate between early and late forms of AMD, but without further differentiation of the "dry" late form. In addition, different studies may employ different classifications of AMD, which inevitably leads to deviations in epidemiological data on AMD. New classification systems take into account microstructural changes that can be detected by high resolution in vivo imaging of the retina. A new consensus classification of AMD-associated atrophy will allow future studies to be conducted according to uniform definitions.\\ Klinisch wird die altersabhängige Makuladegeneration (AMD) in Früh- und Spätstadien eingeteilt. Der Begriff „trockene“ AMD wird häufig verwendet, wenn keine „exsudativen“ Veränderungen am Augenhintergrund vorliegen. Es existiert eine Vielzahl von Studien zur Epidemiologie der AMD. Dabei wird in den meisten Studien zwischen AMD-Früh- und -Spätformen unterschieden, allerdings ohne eine weitere Differenzierung der „trockenen“ AMD-Spätform. Zudem stellt sich die Herausforderung unterschiedlicher Klassifikationen der AMD in verschiedenen Studien, was zwangsläufig zu Abweichungen in den epidemiologischen Daten bei der AMD führt. Neue Klassifikationssysteme berücksichtigen mikrostrukturelle Veränderungen, die mittels hochauflösender In-vivo-Bildgebung der Netzhaut detektiert werden können. Eine neue Konsensusklassifikation der AMD-assoziierten Atrophie soll ermöglichen, zukünftige Studien nach einheitlichen Definitionen durchzuführen.},

   Abstract={Spatially-resolved mapping of rod- and cone-function may facilitate monitoring of macular diseases and serve as a functional outcome parameter. However, mesopic and dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP, also called "microperimetry") constitute laborious examinations. We have devised a machine-learning-based approach to predict mesopic and dark-adapted (DA) retinal sensitivity in eyes with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). Extensive psychophysical testing and volumetric multimodal retinal imaging data were acquired including mesopic, DA red and DA cyan FCP, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy infrared reflectance and fundus autofluorescence imaging. With patient-wise leave-one-out cross-validation, we have been able to achieve prediction accuracies of (mean absolute error, MAE [95% CI]) 3.94 dB [3.38, 4.5] for mesopic, 4.93 dB [4.59, 5.27] for DA cyan and 4.02 dB [3.63, 4.42] for DA red testing. Partial addition of patient-specific sensitivity data decreased the cross-validated MAE to 2.8 dB [2.51, 3.09], 3.71 dB [3.46, 3.96], and 2.85 dB [2.62, 3.08]. The most important predictive feature was outer nuclear layer thickness. This artificial intelligence-based analysis strategy, termed "inferred sensitivity", herein, enables to estimate differential effects of retinal structural abnormalities on cone- and rod-function in nAMD, and may be used as quasi-functional surrogate endpoint in future clinical trials.},

   Abstract={Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common threat to vision loss in individuals older than 50 years. While neovascular complications in AMD are treatable, there is currently no therapy for geographic atrophy secondary to AMD. Geographic atrophy lesion progression over time shows considerable interindividual variability, but little is known about prognostic factors.\\ To elucidate the contribution of common genetic variants to geographic atrophy lesion growth.\\ This pooled analysis combined 4 independent studies: the Fundus Autofluorescence Imaging in Age-Related Macular Degeneration (FAM) study, the Directional Spread in Geographic Atrophy (DSGA) study, the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS), and the Geographic Atrophy Treatment Evaluation (GATE) study. Each provided data for geographic atrophy lesion growth in specific designs. Patients with geographic atrophy secondary to AMD were recruited to these studies. Genotypes were retrieved through the database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (for AREDS) or generated at the Cologne Center for Genomics (for FAM, DSGA, and GATE).\\ The correlation between square root-transformed geographic atrophy growth rate and 7 596 219 genetic variants passing quality control was estimated using linear regression. The calculations were adjusted for known factors influencing geographic atrophy growth, such as the presence of bilateral geographic atrophy as well as the number of lesion spots and follow-up times.\\ Slopes per allele, 95% CIs, and P values of genetic variants correlated with geographic atrophy lesion growth.\\ A total of 935 patients (mean [SD] age, 74.7 [7.8] years; 547 female participants [59.0%]) were included. Two gene loci with conservative genome-wide significance were identified. Each minor allele of the genome-wide associated variants increased the geographic atrophy growth rate by a mean of about 15% or 0.05 mm per year. Gene prioritization within each locus suggests the protein arginine methyltransferase 6 gene (PRMT6; chromosome 1; slope, 0.046 [95% CI, 0.026-0.066]; P = 4.09 × 10-8) and the lanosterol synthase gene (LSS; chromosome 21; slope, 0.105 [95% CI, 0.068-0.143]; P = 4.07 × 10-7) as the most likely progression-associated genes.\\ These data provide further insight into the genetic architecture of geographic atrophy lesion growth. Geographic atrophy is a clinical outcome with a high medical need for effective therapy. The genes PRMT6 and LSS are promising candidates for future studies aimed at understanding functional aspects of geographic atrophy progression and also for designing novel and targeted treatment options.},

   Abstract={Macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) is a bilateral neurodegenerative disorder of the central macula. Previous findings indicated more functional impairment in low light conditions. We sought to further characterize retinal dysfunction using dark-adapted two-color fundus-controlled perimetry ("scotopic microperimetry").\\ Participants of the MacTel Natural History Observation Registry study and age-matched healthy controls underwent retinal imaging including dual wavelength autofluorescence macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurement. Retinal sensitivity was assessed with scotopic microperimetry using cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm). Disease was graded into classes of MPOD loss (0 to 3). For perimetry analysis, the differences of the mean sensitivities (MacTel minus controls) were compared at each test location and the results were aggregated to global indices.\\ Thirty-four eyes (19 patients, mean age 62.2 years) were compared with 25 eyes (25 controls, mean age 61.5 years). Both cyan and red sensitivity were lower in MacTel. This was more pronounced at one- and three-degree eccentricity. Eyes with MPOD class 0 did not exhibit a functional deficit. Class 1 had impaired cyan, but normal red sensitivity. Class 2 and 3 behaved similarly and had impaired cyan and red sensitivity with a relatively higher cyan impairment.\\ Rods might be compromised to a greater extent than cones. Linking to previous studies, our results might also hint toward (postreceptoral) dysfunction of the cone system in very early disease stages. Macular pigment loss and global perimetry indices seemed to reflect functional impairment and might be useful as adjunct measures for disease progression.},

The minimal required reading rectangle (M3R), 19 letters × 2.4 lines in the smallest readable print size of an individual eye, was computed. The status of the M3R was determined as either free of atrophy or involved in the atrophic process, and the impact on reading was assessed.\\ Radner reading score (logRAD) and reading speed (words per minute [wpm]).\\ 0.001) and reading speed (110.84 wpm [IQR, 90.0-131.92 wpm] vs. 162.34 wpm [IQR, 137.51-176.66 wpm]; P = 0.002). Eyes in which the M3R was nonatrophic additionally showed an increase in reading speed with decreasing print size (peak increase, +73.08 wpm [IQR, 27.43-86.64 wpm] compared with the largest test sentence).\\ The results indicate that a defined area on the retina that can be assessed by retinal imaging is required for unhindered reading in patients with foveal-sparing GA. The findings highlight that smaller test sentences can be read faster by patients with this AMD subphenotype. Our results allow prediction of reading impairment based on imaging parameters in clinical routine and may support establishing anatomic surrogate end points in clinical trials. Furthermore, the findings could be used to facilitate the adjustment of magnifying reading aids.},

Lesions with definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF) and questionably decreased autofluorescence (QDAF) in GAF and BAF imaging were analyzed separately by five independent readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder, Heidelberg Engineering). Intermodality and interreader agreements were assessed for the square-root lesion size, lesion perimeter, and circularity.\\ GAF- and BAF-based measurements of DDAF and QDAF showed high intermodality and interreader agreement concerning square-root lesion size, as well as shape descriptive parameters (perimeter and circularity). Interreader agreement of square-root lesion size was slightly, hence not significantly higher for GAF-based grading ([95% coefficients of repeatability, intraclass correlation coefficient] DDAF: 0.215 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.712 mm, 0.981) compared to BAF-based grading (DDAF: 0.232 mm, 0.997; QDAF: 0.764 mm, 0.978). However, DDAF-measurements revealed distinctly more reproducible results than QDAF-measurements. Foveal sparing did not interfere with intermodality agreement.\\ Both GAF- and BAF-based quantification of RPE atrophy showed very reliable results with possible superiority of GAF in the context of less energetic excitation light.\\ The high interreader agreement qualifies the use of DDAF progression in GAF and BAF imaging as potential morphologic outcome measure for interventional clinical trials and disease monitoring.},

Serial fundus autofluorescence images were annotated using semiautomated image analysis software to determine the lesion area, circularity, perimeter, and caliper diameters. These variables and the fundus autofluorescence phenotype were evaluated for prediction of the future square root progression rates using linear mixed-effects models.\\ For the combined model, leave-one-out cross validation on patient level (Scenario 1: previously unknown patient) resulted in a goodness-to-fit (R value) of 0.244 and leave-one-out cross validation on visit level (Scenario 2: previous observation of the patient) in a R value of 0.391. This indicated that shape-descriptive factors could explain 24.4% of the variance in geographic atrophy progression in previously unknown patients and 39.1% in patients with previous observation.\\ These findings confirm the relevance of shape-descriptive factors and previous progression as prognostic variables for geographic atrophy progression. However, a substantial part of the remaining variation in geographic atrophy progression seems to depend on other variables, some of which are visible in optical coherence tomography.},

Development, manifestation, and further progression of complete retinal pigment epithelium and outer retinal atrophy (cRORA) by multimodal imaging data were compared with atrophy detection based on color fundus photography only.\\ Seventeen study eyes with development of central cRORA within 6 years (cumulative rate: 17.4%) were identified based on multimodal imaging. In 10 (60%) of these eyes, presence of central manifest atrophy was initially not detectable by color fundus photography. In six (35%) eyes, central cRORA occurred by the spread of existing paracentral atrophy toward the fovea. Drusen-associated atrophy development was noted in eight eyes. In two eyes, atrophy development was associated with refractile deposits, while only pigmentary changes in absence of large drusen or refractile deposits were detectable before atrophy occurrence in one eye.\\ The earlier and more precise detection of central cRORA by multimodal imaging as compared to atrophy detection solely based on color fundus photography allows for more accurate detection and identification of different pathways for atrophy development. In accordance with previous clinical and histopathologic reports, the results confirm that different precursor lesions may independently proceed to central cRORA in AMD.},

   Abstract={To analyse the retest reliability of visual field indices and to describe patterns of visual field deficits in mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour fundus-controlled perimetry (FCP) in macular diseases.\\ Seventy-seven eyes (30 eyes with macular diseases and 47 normal eyes) underwent duplicate mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour FCP (Scotopic Macular Integrity Assessment, CenterVue). Non-weighted (mean defect, loss variance), variability-weighted (mean deviation, pattern standard deviation (PSD)) and graphical (cumulative defect (Bebie) curves) indices were computed. Reproducibility (coefficient of repeatability, CoR) of these indices was assessed. Cluster analysis was carried out to identify patterns of visual field deficits.\\ 0.95) with varying degrees of global versus focal defect and rod versus cone dysfunction. These were also reflected by the cumulative defect curves.\\ FCP with mesopic and dark-adapted two-colour testing allows for reproducible assessment of different types of retinal sensitivity, whereby mean deviation and PSD exhibited the better retest reliability of the tested indices. Distinct patterns of retinal dysfunction can be identified using this setup, reflecting variable degrees of rod and cone dysfunction in different macular diseases. Dark-adapted two-colour FCP provides additional diagnostic information and allows for refined structure-function correlation in macular diseases.},

   Abstract={The aim of this study is to assess the effect of repeated injections of dexamethasone implants in patients with persistent diabetic macular edema (DME) despite prior therapies.\\ This retrospective interventional study involved 47 DME-afflicted eyes, which were administered ≥2 intravitreal injections of dexamethasone. Group 1 (34 eyes) received a dexamethasone monotherapy, whereas group 2 (13 eyes) received a combination therapy with intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor as needed. The duration of dexamethasone effect until retreatment and the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central retinal thickness (CRT) were defined as outcome measures.\\ A total of 197 injections of dexamethasone were administered in group 1 and 52 in group 2 during a mean follow-up of 23 ± 10 and 24 ± 13 months, respectively. Mean time to reinjection was 4.6 ± 0.5 (group 1) and 5.3 ± 1.0 months (group 2; P = 0.17). Reinjection intervals did not shorten over time for up to 10 dexamethasone injections per eye in group 1 and BCVA improved from before 1 month after the first implantation, 7.0 letters (P = 0.04). In group 2, there was no significant improvement in BCVA at any time point. CRT decreased from 534 ± 208 and 529 ± 215 μm to 287 ± 115 and 371 ± 78 μm at 3 months and increased to 460 ± 186 μm and 547 ± 175 μm before reinjection (groups1 and 2, respectively). The maximal CRT before each implantation remained stable over time.\\ In eyes with chronic DME that respond incompletely to prior therapy or require frequent reinjections, dexamethasone shows promising long-term anatomic and functional improvement. The absence of a treatment effect reduction over time argues against a relevant rebound phenomenon.},

   Abstract={To quantify vessel density (VD) and grey value (GV) as a measure of flow in the choriocapillaris (CC) in healthy subjects with optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA).\\ In this prospective, noncomparative case series, 3 mm × 3 mm OCTA images of 36 eyes of 22 healthy individuals were obtained using a swept-source instrument. VD and GV levels were calculated on CC en face slabs in the central 1-mm (subfoveal field) and surrounding 2.5-mm parafoveal ring. VD was calculated as a ratio of vessel area over nonvessel area following image binarization. GV was computed as the mean, un-normalized greyscale intensity value for all pixels in the region of interest. For each eye, the procedure was repeated 1 minute to 2 minutes later and intersession repeatability was analyzed. The choroidal thickness (CT) was automatically measured in the subfoveal and parafoveal regions and compared to VD and GV values.\\ The VD ratio and GV was lower in the subfoveal field than in the parafoveal four sectors. The intersession intraclass correlation coefficients were high for both VD and GV measurements. There was no correlation observed between CT and VD or GV.\\ Quantitative metrics can be obtained from CC OCTA en face images. These values show moderate to good intersession repeatability. These normative data may be of value as a reference of comparison in future studies of eyes with disease. [Ophthalmic Surg Lasers Imaging Retina. 2017;48:623-631.].},

For the S-MAIA device, cyan (505 nm) and red (627 nm) scotopic FCP were performed. For both devices, a grid of 56 stimulus points covering 16° of the central macula was used. Examination time, fixation stability, and threshold values were analyzed.\\ The upper end of the dynamic range (≤4 dB of lowest threshold) was frequently reached by the MP-1S for mesopic testing (median 34 of 56 stimuli), while threshold values within the lower 4 dB of the dynamic range were occasionally found with the S-MAIA for scotopic testing (median 3 for cyan, median 2 for red). After correction of the stimulus intensity for the S-MAIA results, the median difference for all stimuli between both devices for mesopic testing was -2.0 dB (interquartile range [-4;0], range -14 to 6).\\ The results indicate that robust testing of mesopic and scotopic function is feasible with both devices in patients with AMD, although both devices are susceptible to floor and ceiling effects.\\ The interpretation and particularly the comparison of both scotopic and mesopic FCP results between the MP-1S and the S-MAIA in AMD eyes need to consider variable susceptibility of floor and ceiling effects. Further software updates are desirable as FCP captures visual functional loss that is not noted with best-corrected central visual acuity and is important for clinical trials in AMD.},

The EDR, the number of DS, and the retest reliability for point-wise sensitivity (PWS) were analyzed. The effects of fixation stability, sensitivity, and age on retest reliability were examined using mixed-effects models.\\ The EDR was 10 to 30 dB with five DS for mesopic and 4 to 17 dB with four DS for dark-adapted cyan and red testing. PWS retest reliability was good among all three types of retinal sensitivity assessments (coefficient of repeatability ±5.79, ±4.72, and ±4.77 dB, respectively) and did not depend on fixation stability or age. PWS had no effect on retest variability in dark-adapted cyan and dark-adapted red testing but had a minor effect in mesopic testing.\\ Combined mesopic and dark-adapted two-color FCP allows for reliable topographic testing of cone and rod function in patients with various macular diseases with and without foveal fixation. Retest reliability is homogeneous across eccentricities and various degrees of scotoma depth, including zones at risk for disease progression. These reliability estimates can serve for the design of future clinical trials.},

GA areas were analyzed in GAF, BAF combined with NIR (BAF+NIR), or BAF alone, by four independent readers using semiautomated software (RegionFinder; Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). A mixed-effects model was used to assess the effect of image modality on the measured square-root lesion area. The coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were assessed for the square-root lesion area, lesion perimeter, and circularity.\\ GAF-based measurements were on average 0.062 mm (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.04-0.08 mm) larger than BAF+NIR-based measurements and 0.077 mm (95% CI 0.06 - 0.10 mm) larger than BAF-based measurements. Interreader agreement was highest for GAF-based analysis ([CR, ICC] 0.196 mm, 0.995) followed by BAF+NIR (0.232 mm, 0.992) and BAF alone (0.263 mm, 0.991). The same was noted for the lesion perimeter and circularity. Post hoc review revealed that interreader differences were associated with media opacification interfering with lesion boundary demarcation to a larger extent in BAF than in GAF.\\ cSLO-based GAF and combined BAF+NIR imaging with semiautomated lesion delineation allow for an accurate and reproducible quantification of GA. The slightly better interreader agreement using cSLO GAF suggests that its use may be preferable in clinical trials examining the change in lesion size as a clinical endpoint.},

   Abstract={To investigate the potential of optical coherence tomography (OCT) angiography to detect and quantify the neovascular network in exudative AMD.\\ Treatment-naïve eyes that were diagnosed with exudative AMD were prospectively examined by OCT angiography (OCT-A). The extent of the neovascular network was measured by three independent readers. Interclass-correlation coefficient and area overlap coefficients (OC) were calculated to assess locally precise agreement between measurements. As a reference for interreader agreement, the extent of the neovascular network was further measured on fluorescein angiography (FA) images.\\ A total of 31 eyes (27 patients, mean age 82.5 years, 15 female) were included in the study. Neovascularization subtype was classified as type I in 5, type II in 11, type III in 9, and mixed in 6 eyes, respectively. Interreader agreement for measurements of the neovascular network was 0.884 for OCT-A and 0.636 for FA. Overlap coefficient was 0.705 (interquartile [IQR]: 0.450-0.76) for OCT-A and 0.704 (IQR: 0.673-0.750) for FA, respectively. Area agreement was weaker in type III and mixed lesions.\\ Optical coherence tomography angiography-based measurements of the new vessel complex in neovascular AMD are feasible with interreader agreement comparable with the values obtained for FA. The results underscore the potential of OCT-A as a noninvasive diagnostic tool in neovascular AMD. Yet, further studies will be required to reveal the origin of poor agreement observed in single eyes and to advance OCT-A toward dependable use (e.g., in a reading center context).},

   Abstract={We compared the area of the foveal avascular zone (FAZ) and macular capillary network density at different retinal layers using swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in normal individuals and patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR).\\ Images (a 3 × 3 mm cube centered on the fovea) were acquired in 40 eyes of 22 normal individuals and 28 eyes of 18 patients with varying levels of DR using a swept-source OCT-A device (central wavelength 1050 nm; A-scan-rate of 100,000 scans per second). En face images of the retinal vasculature were generated from the superficial and deep retinal layers (SRL/DRL). Quantitative analysis of the vessel density (VD) and FAZ area was performed. Vessel density was assessed as the ratio of the retinal area occupied by vessels.\\ 0.001; DRL, P = 0.028).\\ Swept-source OCT-A of the microcirculation in eyes of patients with DR can be used to quantitatively demonstrate alterations in the FAZ and VD in the SRL/DRL of the macula compared to normal eyes. Future longitudinal studies may use these metrics to evaluate changes over time or in response to treatment.},

A genetic risk score (GRS) was calculated and compared with patients with nondiffuse-trickling GA (ndt-GA; n = 311) and individuals from the 1000 genomes project (1000G; n = 267). Given the phenotypic overlap between diffuse-trickling and late-onset retinal degeneration (LORD), all C1QTNF5 exons and their exon/intron boundaries were sequenced.\\ 0.01). Sequencing of C1QTNF5 revealed 28 unique variants although none showed a statistically significant association with dt-GA when compared with 1000G individuals.\\ The dt-GA phenotype shows a remarkably different genetic risk profile from other GA phenotypes secondary to AMD. Disease-associated C1QTNF5 mutations were not identified. Together, these results suggest that the dt-GA phenotype is associated with a genetic background substantially different from other GA phenotypes and underlines the necessity to refine the clinical phenotyping, specifically when aiming for individualized therapies in AMD.},

A standardized review was used to assess whether iOCT imaging resulted in additional information and/or altered decision-making.\\ The iOCT system was usable in conjunction with common chromovitrectomy dyes and tamponades. The surgeons reported that iOCT imaging provided additional information in 74.1% of the posterior and combined surgical cases, which resulted in altered decision-making in 41.9% of the cases. The iOCT imaging time, on average, amounted to 167 seconds. In anterior procedures, the surgeons reported gaining additional information in 22.2% of all cases, but no cases of altered decision-making were reported. Hereby, the iOCT imaging time amounted to 117 seconds, on average.\\ The demonstrated results suggest iOCT has the potential to improve the quality of posterior and anterior segment surgery.},

   Abstract={After 48 months, unresolved macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) is present in more than half of the patients treated with ranibizumab/bevacizumab. Switching therapy to aflibercept, a more recent vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) inhibitor, as well as VEGF-B and placental growth factor inhibitor, might improve the clinical outcome in patients with CRVO who respond insufficiently to ranibizumab/bevacizumab.\\ The presented study is a retrospective analysis of CRVO patients (n = 13) responding insufficiently to ranibizumab and/or bevacizumab (requiring treatment every 6 weeks or more frequently). Treatment in these patients was switched to aflibercept, which was administered based on a 'treat and extend' regime. The injection interval, relapse-free interval, central retinal thickness, central retinal volume, visual acuity, and intraocular pressure (IOP) were evaluated prior to switching to aflibercept and at month 6 and year 1 after switching therapy.\\ From baseline to year 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept, the mean injection interval (primary end point) increased by 0.51 months (p = 0.023) and the relapse-free interval by 3.02 weeks (p = 0.003). The mean central retinal thickness decreased by 195.84 µm and the mean central retinal volume (6 mm diameter) by -1.81 mm3 (p = 0.007). Correspondingly, the mean ETDRS score increased from 66.15 at baseline to 76.54 letters at year 1 after switching therapy to aflibercept (+10.38 letters, p = 0.021). The IOP was not statistically significantly affected (-1.2 mm Hg, p = 0.196).\\ Switching therapy from intravitreal ranibizumab/bevacizumab to aflibercept in insufficiently responding macular edema secondary to CRVO elongates the injection interval and the relapse-free interval and provides an improved anatomical as well as functional outcome.},

   Abstract={To analyze foveal avascular zone (FAZ) dimensions and symmetry in patients with diabetic retinopathy (DR) compared to healthy controls using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT angiography).\\ OCT angiography was performed via an Avanti® RTVue 100 XR OCT system (Optovue, Inc., Fremont, CA, USA) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and healthy adults. A frame centered on the fovea was used for FAZ measurements. The borders of the superficial vascular layer were defined as 3 μm below the internal limiting membrane (ILM) and 15 μm below the inner plexiform layer (IPL), and for the deep vascular layer as15 μm and 70 μm below the IPL, respectively. Angles of maximum FAZ diameter were measured in all eyes by two graders.\\ In healthy eyes (N = 25), the FAZ surrounding vascular arcades were intact, showing a vertical or horizontal oval symmetrical formation with a maximum diameter usually on the horizontal or vertical axis. Diabetic eyes (N = 29) presented with disintegrity of the vascular arcades, resulting in an enlarged FAZ. In the superficial layer, the mean horizontal FAZ diameter was significantly larger in the DR group (753 μm ±272 μm) than in the control group (573 μm ±177 μm, p = 0.029). The difference was even more pronounced in the deep layer, with a mean value of 659 μm ±194 μm in the control group and 1009 μm ±342 μm in the DR group (p = 0.001). Furthermore, in the superficial layer, the angle of the maximum FAZ diameter was 0° (±15°) or 90° (±15°) in 72.0 % of healthy eyes. In eyes with DR, the angle was 0° (±15°) or 90° (±15°) in only 6.9 % of cases, due to the irregular configuration of the FAZ.\\ OCT angiography is capable of imaging retinal vasculature without dye injection. Our data suggest that it can detect disintegrity of the vascular arcades surrounding the FAZ, thus differentiating DM from healthy eyes. Vascular abnormalities were more pronounced in the deep vascular layer.},

   Abstract={Munc18-1, a SEC1/Munc18 protein and key regulatory protein in synaptic transmission, can either promote or inhibit SNARE complex assembly. Although the binary inhibitory interaction between Munc18-1 and closed syntaxin 1 is well described, the mechanism of how Munc18-1 stimulates membrane fusion remains elusive. Using a reconstituted assay that resolves vesicle docking, priming, clamping, and fusion during synaptic exocytosis, we show that helix 12 in domain 3a of Munc18-1 stimulates SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. A single point mutation (L348R) within helix 12 selectively abolishes VAMP2 binding and the stimulatory function of Munc18-1 in membrane fusion. In contrast, targeting a natural switch site (P335A) at the start of helix 12, which can result in an extended α-helical conformation, further accelerates lipid-mixing. Together with structural modeling, the data suggest that helix 12 provides a folding template for VAMP2, accelerating SNAREpin assembly and membrane fusion. Analogous SEC1/Munc18-SNARE interactions at other transport steps may provide a general mechanism to drive lipid bilayer merger. At the neuronal synapse, Munc18-1 may convert docked synaptic vesicles into a readily releasable pool.},
